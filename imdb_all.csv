Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,6.5,"['Rebecca Hall', 'Brian Tyree Henry', 'Dan Stevens', 'Kaylee Hottle', 'Alex Ferns']",Adam Wingard,2024.0,action,"Monster = hurrah
Humans = garbageAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:
If you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these ""characters"" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:
Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the ""dialogues"" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of ""the new empire"" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14539740/?ref_=sr_i_1
The Gentlemen,8.2,"['Theo James', 'Kaya Scodelario', 'Daniel Ings', 'Joely Richardson', 'Vinnie Jones']",Creator,2024.0,action,"Taking the same path of the movie, this Netflix series follows the adventures of former soldier and recently titled Eddie, who inherits the family estate, and unknowingly, a joint-venture weed empire with a London gang.And it's this entertaining clash of old-English aristocracy and contemporary London drug gang that makes this series entertaining. Eddies older brother, Freddie, who should have inherited, is errant if well meaning, provides some classic ineptitude for comedy value.And there's a good balance of romantic tension between Eddie and the daughter of the gang's boss to keep you guessing. The casting is good, production values high and storylines engaging.Witty, stylish and fun, it's a good addition to the Netflix lineup. Not too serious and gory, but with enough tension and characters to keep you entertained.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13210838/?ref_=sr_i_2
Road House,6.2,"['Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Daniela Melchior', 'Conor McGregor', 'Billy Magnussen', 'Jessica Williams']",Doug Liman,2024.0,action,"One of the great things about the original Road House was seeing Dalton clean house and improve the bar bit by bit. That is severely lacking here with next to no time spent in the actual Road House and barely any screen time is given to the people at the bar. One of the highlights of the Swayze movie was him getting to know the staff and getting rid of the bad elements at the bar. Nothing of the sort goes on in this movie.Jaoquim de Almeida is wasted as the sheriff and has little to do while Daniela Melchior has less of a role than Kelly Lynch had in the original if that was possible.The movie's saving grace is Jake Gyllenhaal who is clearly having a lot of fun in the role and has good chemistry with an OTT Conor McGregor in the movies best moments. Best stick to the original cult classic.(Glad to see Arturo Castro's Moe live, by far and away the best character in the whole movie).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3359350/?ref_=sr_i_3
Dune: Part Two,8.8,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Zendaya', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Javier Bardem', 'Josh Brolin']",Denis Villeneuve,2024.0,action,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/?ref_=sr_i_4
Invincible,8.7,"['Steven Yeun', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Sandra Oh', 'Grey Griffin', 'Zazie Beetz']",Creators,2021.0,action,"Invincible takes the classic Image Comics series and gives us the best mature animated superhero series since Spawn: The Animated Series. Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.Invincible feels like an extension of the shows so many of us grew up with, and a maturing of the kinds of stories Bruce Timm started off years ago, without losing the sense of superhero fun. It's character-drama, action-adventure, 'cape-opera', and universe-making stuff that proves it's truly special.Invincible is must-watch television. Thank goodness it's been renewed for seasons 2 & 3.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6741278/?ref_=sr_i_5
Renegade Nell,7.4,"['Louisa Harland', 'Frank Dillane', 'Alice Kremelberg', 'Enyi Okoronkwo', 'Bo Bragason']",Creator,2024.0,action,"Initial score: 8
Just two episodes in and and I find this series extremely good. Acting, story and action scenes are all well done.I love the setting and the fact that it mixes period drama and fantasy. The leading actress is well cast which is something rare these days. Thank God not another Instagram plastic with duck lips but a real person, believable for that day and age.Also great work on the villains of the story. Well written, not two dimensional and with appropriate menace and self conflict.I hope it keeps that standards of the first episodes. I will update my rating, up or down accordingly as I watch more. But from what I've seen it most probably go up.EDIT: well, that was unfortunate. It seems the creators, writers, directors had only two good episodes in them. The rest 6 are plagued by bad writing, no action scenes and that of low quality, unfocused plot. It even has a cruella de vil character and a queen that obviously lives in a stable and no means to protect her. Awful.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14502758/?ref_=sr_i_6
Monkey Man,7.3,"['Dev Patel', 'Sharlto Copley', 'Pitobash', 'Vipin Sharma', 'Sikandar Kher']",Dev Patel,2024.0,action,"""Only God can forgive you now""Man. What a wild ride. Violent, fast paced yet beautifully shot. Great effort by Dev Patel on his directorial debut. He has managed to create a worthwhile action film with some great set pieces, neck, breaking stunts and an overall good looking film.I think what triumphs the most is the fast pace, headache inducing editing (this is a positive) with some great colour schemes and set pieces. It's fast paced editing matched the chaotic streets of India, mixed with its rich culture and history.The soundtrack was reminiscent of John Wick, with it's party scenes and colour palette. There was some great cinematography, especially through its use of silhouettes towards the final act.You can see the directors, aim to portray the monkey man, as a legendary figure who supports the powerless, and the impoverished of India's lower class. He makes a stand against those who are in control, which is a great pairing for an action/revenge film.I will say that the second act does falter a bit in its speed and does drag down in some places however, it quickly picks up pace again in the last act where monkey man turns into a proper beast.You can see the message the director portrayed as he highlights the inequality surrounding the poor in India and uses this medium to show that there is hope and people willing to make a stand against those who are in control.All in all a decent action film with great choreography, stunts, soundtrack and editing. This is an enjoyable watch, but doesn't elevate much further than your standard action flick.All praise for Indian John Wick!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9214772/?ref_=sr_i_7
Game of Thrones,9.2,"['Emilia Clarke', 'Peter Dinklage', 'Kit Harington', 'Lena Headey', 'Sophie Turner']",Creators,2011.0,action,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=sr_i_8
Road House,6.7,"['Patrick Swayze', 'Kelly Lynch', 'Sam Elliott', 'Ben Gazzara', 'Marshall R. Teague']",Rowdy Herrington,1989.0,action,"Patrick Swayze, a classically trained ballet dancer, plays Dalton, who is hired to be the head bouncer (the ""cooler"") of a wild bar down in the bayou called the Double Deuce. Things get a little out of hand when the local mob boss (played by Ben Gazzara, perhaps better known as The Big Lebowski's Jackie Treehorn) wants to fight. Luckily, Dalton has a friend... an old-time bouncer played by Sam Elliott.This film is mentioned as Dawson Leery's (from ""Dawson's Creek"") favorite movie, which seems really odd for a character who emulates Spielberg. The film is non-stop fight scenes that extend into full bar brawls. Okay, wait, not non-stop... there's also a fair amount of sex. Sex and nudity (both male and female). You will see more of Sam Elliott than you ever thought you would. And then back to the fighting.The bar brawls were enough to earn it the title of ""Second Best Fight Movie Ever"" (behind ""They Live"", though the choreography of ""Clockwork Orange"" is impressive) in my mind, but then the fights turn grotesquely violent. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. I find this to be the selling point of the film, knowing that Dalton has the strength and training to rip a man's windpipe out through his neck. Yet, he has the cool calmness of a zen master (one wonders how his majoring in philosophy fits into his character... if at all).There are a few things that seem strange if you're being picky. All stores and houses are packed wall to wall with propane tanks apparently, as explosions happen for no reason. Cops don't show up for fires, bar fights or the destruction of an entire car dealership (by a monster truck). They do show up once in the film without being called, when their presence no longer matters.This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again. Not because it's a great film (although it is pretty darn good)... but because its absurdity is, well, absurd. The film takes place in a universe I can only dream of. Which, being a late 1980s film, I guess makes it perfectly normal in some way. Well, whatever the case, I loved it and you should love it, too.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/?ref_=sr_i_9
Civil War,7.7,"['Nick Offerman', 'Kirsten Dunst', 'Wagner Moura', 'Jefferson White', 'Nelson Lee']",Alex Garland,2024.0,action,"I was genuinely incredibly impressed by this movie. After watching the trailer, I was expecting an Expendables type of film. The reality is that this movie is brilliant. A dark twist and a brief insight into photo journalism and the horrors of war. A lot of time and effort has clearly gone into the production of this film. The way the actors move and react to situations added to the realism and added to the enjoyment of the viewer. Kirstin Dunst wasn't my first choice but her performance was spot on. I would recommend watching this film in IMax at the cinema. A lot of the drama would not necessarily be transferred to the small screen. Highly recommend.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17279496/?ref_=sr_i_10

The only issue I had was the development and backstory behind each of the main characters, which I feel could've been handled a bit better. This film is definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to pacing, but I personally liked that it took its time and had no issue with it. Dune is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time and in terms of scale and epicness it is right up there with Lord of the Rings.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_=sr_i_11

It seems like many of the recent adaptations have fallen flat and abandoned aspects of the original material which were vital to the essence of what made it special. Happily, the show exceeded my expectations and kept the violent, fun, retro atmosphere. Great casting, plot, costumes, makeup, set design, and perhaps most importantly, music. Overall, the show was very well done and remained true to the imagery of the game, albeit with some points I think could have been done differently with better effect.

This is not an indie Oscar Winner movie and it doesn't pretend to be neither.Stop trying to look for art in everything, like there are Bethoveen masterpieces and Tomorrowland EDM music to just jump around there are also movies to admire with all your senses and movies to enjoy on a Sunday evening.The movie is good and it doesn't deserve to be bashed because people were looking for another Schindler's List on it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13452446/?ref_=sr_i_14
The Gentlemen,7.8,"['Matthew McConaughey', 'Charlie Hunnam', 'Michelle Dockery', 'Jeremy Strong', 'Lyne Ren√©e']",Guy Ritchie,2019.0,action,"Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for ¬£400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8367814/?ref_=sr_i_15
Star Trek: Discovery,7.0,"['Sonequa Martin-Green', 'Doug Jones', 'Anthony Rapp', 'Emily Coutts', 'Mary Wiseman']",Creators,2017.0,action,"The first season was ok and had a promising start but it rapidly decayed into a sappy soap opera set in the Star Trek universe. The characters in the show and the plot have all the potential needed but the continuing agony of ongoing psychology sessions (they call them episodes) is making me reconsider my future and I'll need counselling, long into the future, for having watched this. Writing this is part of my exposure therapy after season 4 where my brain was set to stun. But seriously, so disappointed that the focus was on giving out life lessons and not writing good Star Trek stories. I get it that you can have positive messages in shows, not a bad thing, but this is just way too much, at the expense of a potentially good series.In my personal unscientific rating scale 4=Forced myself to watch to the end but didn't really enjoy and won't watch it again.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=sr_i_16
Kung Fu Panda 4,6.4,"['Jack Black', 'Awkwafina', 'Viola Davis', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Bryan Cranston']",Mike Mitchell,2024.0,action,"I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21692408/?ref_=sr_i_17

Not sure what changed behind the scenes, but it was a good thing, whatever happened.I watched season one because of the effects, which were pretty great! Now, I'm watching because of the story too, which is pretty good! I used to watch the old school Doctor Who because of the story, not the effects budget, which was probably about $150.

This gave that same kind of vibe early on within the first two episodes.This seems to pic up where the 90s Saturday morning cartoon left off. What was corny and cool for me as a kid, has been adapted now to be still good writing but not perceived as corny as an adult.

Sometimes almost inelegant? Yes. It uses a few too many tricks a little too frequently. But the result remains captivating, diving into the world of female body builders while mixing film genres and cinematographic styles, to create a unique film.

I see comments like she is unlikeable. However, if you watch all 3 released epis you will see her character evolve and evolve again. Give her a chance. Her power is quite bizarre. The manifestation of it is a horror. However, it has some interesting applications that one might not see at first until it is used. I believe her and the girl playing her roommate, are actresses to watch out for in the future.In fact, the young cast as a whole, all unknown to me, are very solid. The blond who dates Golden Boy (played by Arnie's son) stood out to me as well, as does the guy who plays the Magneto-like supe.Clancy Brown has a small but important role with this one soliloquy that was excellently done, and just evil.If you like The Boys, then I don't see why you would not like this show.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13159924/?ref_=sr_i_25

Abby is perfectly believable, despite the goth overtones...she is strong, smart, yet still sexy and feminine.  I think Pauley Perette was the ideal actress to cast.  The writing seems to continue at an even keel...if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown.  I think the producers have a hit here.  I go back each week.  Definitely worth your time...even if it means taping or tivo'ing it (which I do)...something to look forward to when I can't make 8:00 on Tuesday.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845/?ref_=sr_i_26
Avatar: The Last Airbender,7.2,"['Gordon Cormier', 'Kiawentiio', 'Ian Ousley', 'Dallas Liu', 'Paul Sun-Hyung Lee']",Creator,2024.0,action,"As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_27

While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast.

In Clone Wars some of the arcs were mature and amazing that build upon the movies and cannon, while some felt like dumb filler with no purpose!The same goes for this show, as some of the episodes are side quests, mainly aimed for kids, and some of the episodes contribute to the overall story, are more dark and mature, especially in season two, and aimed for the more mature or older audience who grew up watching The Clone Wars and the movies!I would say you dont need to watch every episode! Some of the filler episodes can be skipped and you wont miss out! I skipped some of the filler in season two and I enjoyed that season more than one!The animation though is amazing and that goes for every episode, even the ones that don't matter! Soundtrack is also fantastic as it creates a vibe unique to this show!The show might have its ups and downs but is still better than some of the live action star wars shows!Excited for season 3.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12708542/?ref_=sr_i_29

A team are sent it to for some reason grab nitroglycerin from a compound so it can be driving into the raging fire of the refinery and blown in order to save everyone.

I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written?

The movie is exactly what you expect it to be, nothing more nothing less. It seemed liked the writers & director knew how absurd the plot was and embraced it well.

Argylle,5.7,"['Henry Cavill', 'Bryce Dallas Howard', 'Sam Rockwell', 'Bryan Cranston', 'Daniel Singh']",Matthew Vaughn,2024.0,action,"Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15009428/?ref_=sr_i_37
Gisaengsu: Deo Geurei,7.3,"['Jeon So-nee', 'Koo Kyo-hwan', 'Lee Jung-hyun', 'Kwon Hae-hyo', 'Kim In-kwon']",Hitoshi Iwaaki,2024.0,action,"As someone who saw the anime almost a decade ago, which was an adaptation of a manga by the same name, I was very curious how this story could possibly be adapted into live action without looking very silly (see the Japanese live adaptation films).Without spoiling anything, The Grey is not another live-adaptation of the manga, nor is it a sequel to it. It's more like a spin-off. The events that happen in Parasyte, in the original material, we only saw what happened in Japan. The Grey looks at what happens when the parasytes affects a different country. In this sense, you don't have to read the manga or watch the anime, as the TV series cover the worldbuilding fairly well.Now, the big question is, did it end up looking as silly as the films? No. I'd say the special effects in The Grey were awesome. Probably the best parts of the show. It will no doubt look a bit cartoonish still but I was very impressed. How much of it was practical effects? How much was it VFX? They have blended it very well.However, the shaky cam definitely didn't do the show any favours. Maybe it was a necessary evil to make the VFX looks as real as it did, but I rather have the camera stationary so we can focus on the fights, because some of the fights were pretty insane. But again, it might be because the cuts and shaky cams hid a lot of glaring issues and is why it was used.Still, Parasyte was and still is an interesting series just because it asks some interesting questions about humanity, survival, and morality. I don't think the philosophy was as in-depth as the manga or anime, given there were only 6 episodes, but there is enough to ponder here and definitely makes me want to watch the anime again (highly recommended but also has its fair share of flaws). For those who knew the source material, the last couple minutes in this show was super cool to see.In summary, Parasyte has an interesting premise and the TV series did an excellent job adapting it as a live action. Slowly, I think Netflix is producing more and more quality live adaptations which had been known for a long time to be a joke (Cowboy Bebop and Death Note is still a joke but Alice in Wonderland and One Piece was very good).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21874396/?ref_=sr_i_38
Dune,6.3,"['Kyle MacLachlan', 'Virginia Madsen', 'Francesca Annis', 'Leonardo Cimino', 'Brad Dourif']",David Lynch,1984.0,action,"There are two groups of people who write at IMDb, the pessimists and the optimists. The pessimists love to complain about something or other in a film. The optimists try and find something good. DUNE probably ranks as one of those that feels like it's going to be good, but leaves a confusing, lackluster feeling in its wake. In an attempt to be optimistic, I will try focusing ONLY on the good parts. This might be tough.I will give David Lynch credit (indeed, as Frank Herbert did when he saw this) for trying to take an enormous amalgamation of things and ideas from the novel and trying to turn them into a movie. Lynch's visual style is very raw here and everything in the production design seems to be under his spell.The sets, costumes, cinematography, and choice of cast is excellent. All of them lend a flavor of difference that transcends whatever confusion is on the screen. (On the side note: I was sick of hearing Kyle MacLachlan repeating himself over and over) The creature designs by Carlo Rambaldi are very Lynch-ien, even though we rarely get to see them.
Overall, a sci-fi epic that requires a lethargic butt, an open mind, and a copy of Frank Herbert's novel to enjoy. Still, it is far superior to the TV miniseries of late (I know saying that is blasphemy to some). I refuse to rate this with stars or anything else.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=sr_i_39

This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,6.5,"['Rebecca Hall', 'Brian Tyree Henry', 'Dan Stevens', 'Kaylee Hottle', 'Alex Ferns']",Adam Wingard,2024.0,adventure,"Monster = hurrah
Humans = garbageAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:
If you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these ""characters"" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:
Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the ""dialogues"" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of ""the new empire"" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14539740/?ref_=sr_i_3
Dune: Part Two,8.8,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Zendaya', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Javier Bardem', 'Josh Brolin']",Denis Villeneuve,2024.0,adventure,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/?ref_=sr_i_4
Invincible,8.7,"['Steven Yeun', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Sandra Oh', 'Grey Griffin', 'Zazie Beetz']",Creators,2021.0,adventure,"Invincible takes the classic Image Comics series and gives us the best mature animated superhero series since Spawn: The Animated Series. Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.Invincible feels like an extension of the shows so many of us grew up with, and a maturing of the kinds of stories Bruce Timm started off years ago, without losing the sense of superhero fun. It's character-drama, action-adventure, 'cape-opera', and universe-making stuff that proves it's truly special.Invincible is must-watch television.

Just two episodes in and and I find this series extremely good. Acting, story and action scenes are all well done.I love the setting and the fact that it mixes period drama and fantasy. The leading actress is well cast which is something rare these days. Thank God not another Instagram plastic with duck lips but a real person, believable for that day and age.Also great work on the villains of the story. Well written, not two dimensional and with appropriate menace and self conflict.I hope it keeps that standards of the first episodes. I will update my rating, up or down accordingly as I watch more. But from what I've seen it most probably go up.EDIT: well, that was unfortunate. It seems the creators, writers, directors had only two good episodes in them. The rest 6 are plagued by bad writing, no action scenes and that of low quality, unfocused plot.

Game of Thrones,9.2,"['Emilia Clarke', 'Peter Dinklage', 'Kit Harington', 'Lena Headey', 'Sophie Turner']",Creators,2011.0,adventure,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=sr_i_8
Wish,5.6,"['Ariana DeBose', 'Chris Pine', 'Alan Tudyk', 'Angelique Cabral', 'Victor Garber']",Chris Buck,2023.0,adventure,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation.

Dune: Part One,8.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Zendaya', 'Oscar Isaac', 'Jason Momoa']",Denis Villeneuve,2021.0,adventure,"Everything from the visuals to the score and acting was easy 10/10. The only issue I had was the development and backstory behind each of the main characters, which I feel could've been handled a bit better. This film is definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to pacing, but I personally liked that it took its time and had no issue with it. Dune is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time and in terms of scale and epicness it is right up there with Lord of the Rings.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_=sr_i_10
Fallout,8.7,"['Ella Purnell', 'Aaron Moten', 'Walton Goggins', 'Moises Arias', 'Leslie Uggams']",Creators,2024.0,adventure,"As an avid Fallout player, I was both excited and a bit worried to hear about the show. It seems like many of the recent adaptations have fallen flat and abandoned aspects of the original material which were vital to the essence of what made it special. Happily, the show exceeded my expectations and kept the violent, fun, retro atmosphere. Great casting, plot, costumes, makeup, set design, and perhaps most importantly, music. Overall, the show was very well done and remained true to the imagery of the game, albeit with some points I think could have been done differently with better effect.

This is not an indie Oscar Winner movie and it doesn't pretend to be neither.Stop trying to look for art in everything, like there are Bethoveen masterpieces and Tomorrowland EDM music to just jump around there are also movies to admire with all your senses and movies to enjoy on a Sunday evening.The movie is good and it doesn't deserve to be bashed because people were looking for another Schindler's List on it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13452446/?ref_=sr_i_13
Star Trek: Discovery,7.0,"['Sonequa Martin-Green', 'Doug Jones', 'Anthony Rapp', 'Emily Coutts', 'Mary Wiseman']",Creators,2017.0,adventure,"The first season was ok and had a promising start but it rapidly decayed into a sappy soap opera set in the Star Trek universe. The characters in the show and the plot have all the potential needed but the continuing agony of ongoing psychology sessions (they call them episodes) is making me reconsider my future and I'll need counselling, long into the future, for having watched this. Writing this is part of my exposure therapy after season 4 where my brain was set to stun. But seriously, so disappointed that the focus was on giving out life lessons and not writing good Star Trek stories. I get it that you can have positive messages in shows, not a bad thing, but this is just way too much, at the expense of a potentially good series.In my personal unscientific rating scale 4=Forced myself to watch to the end but didn't really enjoy and won't watch it again.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=sr_i_14
Kung Fu Panda 4,6.4,"['Jack Black', 'Awkwafina', 'Viola Davis', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Bryan Cranston']",Mike Mitchell,2024.0,adventure,"I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21692408/?ref_=sr_i_15

However, season 2 is a huge step up from season one, and is actually now a show that I enjoy and look forward to watching. However, it is still not Halo, but damn if season two has not had a few bangers of episodes and you actually care about these characters now, unlike season one. Not sure what changed behind the scenes, but it was a good thing, whatever happened.I watched season one because of the effects, which were pretty great! Now, I'm watching because of the story too, which is pretty good! I used to watch the old school Doctor Who because of the story, not the effects budget, which was probably about $150.

I loved the writing in the first two episodes, it reminds me when I was a kid listening to those epic moments of grandeur dialog from the likes of Apocalypse, and famous quotes and wise sayings from Beast. This gave that same kind of vibe early on within the first two episodes.This seems to pic up where the 90s Saturday morning cartoon left off. What was corny and cool for me as a kid, has been adapted now to be still good writing but not perceived as corny as an adult. In that regard they seemed to have nail their audience, they know that the people watching this would be in their 30s and 40s now.

History Channel decided to double the earnings by doubling the number of episodes in season 4. Without enough content to fill the episodes, the show became slow and boring.

Wonka,7.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Gustave Die', 'Murray McArthur', 'Paul G. Raymond', 'Bertie Caplan']",Paul King,2023.0,adventure,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/?ref_=sr_i_19

What was my surprise when I discovered a real movie.Love Lies Bleeding is one of those movies that catches you from the beginning and never lets you go. Is the filmmaking style a bit excessive? Yes. Sometimes almost inelegant? Yes. It uses a few too many tricks a little too frequently. But the result remains captivating, diving into the world of female body builders while mixing film genres and cinematographic styles, to create a unique film. One that, by the way, is genuinely feminist and lgbtq in an original and authentic way.Kirsten Stewart is outstanding, confirming her as one of the greatest talents in Hollywood today.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19637052/?ref_=sr_i_21
Gen V,7.7,"['Jaz Sinclair', 'Lizze Broadway', 'Maddie Phillips', 'London Thor', 'Derek Luh']",Creators,2023.0,adventure,"I'm older so was very concerned this would be too YA for me, but I gave the first episode a chance and ended up watching all 3 released episodes. The show has the same feel of Boys, but a bit more serious and less outright comical - although there are some very funny bits.I see a lot of complaints about the lead actress - who is very pretty by the way. I see comments like she is unlikeable. However, if you watch all 3 released epis you will see her character evolve and evolve again. Give her a chance. Her power is quite bizarre. The manifestation of it is a horror. However, it has some interesting applications that one might not see at first until it is used. I believe her and the girl playing her roommate, are actresses to watch out for in the future.In fact, the young cast as a whole, all unknown to me, are very solid. The blond who dates Golden Boy (played by Arnie's son) stood out to me as well, as does the guy who plays the Magneto-like supe.Clancy Brown has a small but important role with this one soliloquy that was excellently done, and just evil.If you like The Boys, then I don't see why you would not like this show.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13159924/?ref_=sr_i_22
Avatar: The Last Airbender,7.2,"['Gordon Cormier', 'Kiawentiio', 'Ian Ousley', 'Dallas Liu', 'Paul Sun-Hyung Lee']",Creator,2024.0,adventure,"As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_23

In Clone Wars some of the arcs were mature and amazing that build upon the movies and cannon, while some felt like dumb filler with no purpose!The same goes for this show, as some of the episodes are side quests, mainly aimed for kids, and some of the episodes contribute to the overall story, are more dark and mature, especially in season two, and aimed for the more mature or older audience who grew up watching The Clone Wars and the movies!I would say you dont need to watch every episode! Some of the filler episodes can be skipped and you wont miss out! I skipped some of the filler in season two and I enjoyed that season more than one!The animation though is amazing and that goes for every episode, even the ones that don't matter!

Barbie,6.8,"['Margot Robbie', 'Ryan Gosling', 'Issa Rae', 'Kate McKinnon', 'Alexandra Shipp']",Greta Gerwig,2023.0,adventure,"I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/?ref_=sr_i_27

I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written?

But they kept it at a good level, so I can still watch it with my kids.Most characters feel autentic, Im a bit disapointed on Skalle-Per, he feels like a parodi.And as alway good children actors are hard to find.Loved Ronja, but Birk did not really come up to the standard I expected.If the second part can deliver, I will probably up my score to 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15379396/?ref_=sr_i_30
Dune,6.3,"['Kyle MacLachlan', 'Virginia Madsen', 'Francesca Annis', 'Leonardo Cimino', 'Brad Dourif']",David Lynch,1984.0,adventure,"There are two groups of people who write at IMDb, the pessimists and the optimists. The pessimists love to complain about something or other in a film. The optimists try and find something good. DUNE probably ranks as one of those that feels like it's going to be good, but leaves a confusing, lackluster feeling in its wake. In an attempt to be optimistic, I will try focusing ONLY on the good parts. This might be tough.I will give David Lynch credit (indeed, as Frank Herbert did when he saw this) for trying to take an enormous amalgamation of things and ideas from the novel and trying to turn them into a movie. Lynch's visual style is very raw here and everything in the production design seems to be under his spell.The sets, costumes, cinematography, and choice of cast is excellent. All of them lend a flavor of difference that transcends whatever confusion is on the screen. (On the side note: I was sick of hearing Kyle MacLachlan repeating himself over and over) The creature designs by Carlo Rambaldi are very Lynch-ien, even though we rarely get to see them.
Overall, a sci-fi epic that requires a lethargic butt, an open mind, and a copy of Frank Herbert's novel to enjoy. Still, it is far superior to the TV miniseries of late (I know saying that is blasphemy to some). I refuse to rate this with stars or anything else.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=sr_i_31

Gojira -1.0,8.3,"['Minami Hamabe', 'Sakura And√¥', 'Ryunosuke Kamiki', 'Rikako Miura', 'Yuki Yamada']",Takashi Yamazaki,2023.0,adventure,"I could see the obvious progress of quality from ""Shin-Godzilla"" and other Legendary's Godzilla series. It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand ""Godzilla"". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a ""real"" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23289160/?ref_=sr_i_33

It seems that most agree based off all the terrific reviews from both critics and the audience alike. It's also been nominated for just about every award possible.

It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support. If you're looking for a funny, action-filled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family: go for One Piece.

Interstellar,8.7,"['Matthew McConaughey', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Mackenzie Foy', 'Ellen Burstyn']",Christopher Nolan,2014.0,adventure,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth‚Äîcrops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=sr_i_38
Spaceman,5.7,"['Adam Sandler', 'Carey Mulligan', 'Paul Dano', 'Kunal Nayyar', 'Isabella Rossellini']",Johan Renck,2024.0,adventure,"2 out of 5 stars.Spaceman is a bad science fiction drama film that puts Adam Sandler into another serious sci fi drama. Sadly, the film is very boring and slow. It is no Space Odyssey, or interstellar or the Abyss with some ideas from all of them.Plot is dull. Adam Sandler is travelling through the far reaches of space to investigate a storm cloud. While he is being affected psychologically. Until he meets a spider like alien that helps him through it. While he remembers his past about his wife.Script is dull. And direction is tedious and dry. There is not one exciting moment or something that will be worth talking about. Adam Sandler did his best.

I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what's going to happen, then before I know it the programme is finished and I have to wait to find out what happens next. Utterly gripping! This show is amazing and I hope they continue to make it because often fantastic US shows get cancelled because the ratings start to dip slightly or the executives think the shows are too weird.

Shogun,8.1,"['Richard Chamberlain', 'Toshir√¥ Mifune', 'Y√¥ko Shimada', 'Furank√Æ Sakai', 'Alan Badel']",All cast & crew,1980.0,adventure,"One of the most famous mini-series in television history, ""James Clavell's Shogun"" tells the epic tale of an English pilot who is washed up on the shores of Japan in the 17th century and becomes involved in the local political struggles. ""Shogun"" proves to be both an engrossing story, and a fascinating piece of television history.Based on the life of the English navigator William Adams, ""Shogun"" is a complex story that explores both the political struggles of Feudal Japan, as well as analyzes the cultural differences of East vs. West. The story revolves around Pilot Major John Blackthorne, played by Richard Chamberlain. Coerced by Catholic Portuguese missionaries, with whom the English were at war, the Japanese authorities, or daimyos, throw the shipwrecked Blackthorne and his ailing crew into prison, and torture them as pirates. We soon learn that Lord Toranaga, the most powerful daimyo in Japan, is in the midst of a power struggle that could possibly lead him to be Shogun--the most powerful military ruler in Japan. In a final interview before his execution, Toranaga sees Blackthorne as valuable, and he spares the Englishman's life. Toranaga decides to employ him in training his troops in the Western methods of battle to help them prepare for the upcoming war against his rival, Ishido. Along the way, the audience is given a fascinating introduction to Feudal Japan through Blackthorne's eyes.Shot entirely in Japan, director Jerry London took great care in using authentic costumes and believable sets. The casting is commendable, with Richard Chamberlain embodying the perfect Blackthorne (his performance garnered an Emmy nomination in 1980). Lord Toranaga is played masterfully by Toshiro Mifune, who also appeared in Akira Kurasawa classics such as Yojimbo and The Hidden Fortress.Without a doubt, ""James Clavell's Shogun"" is worth a watch.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/?ref_=sr_i_41

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,6.8,"['Rachel Zegler', 'Tom Blyth', 'Viola Davis', 'Dexter Sol Ansell', 'Rosa Gotzler']",Francis Lawrence,2023.0,adventure,"""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10545296/?ref_=sr_i_43

Same face, same words, same acting repeating on every single episode.So overall, just cheesy entertainment not to think too much.

It's got everything you could hope to see in a racing land adventure - with risks and danger at every corner; it keeps the pulse up and the stakes are high for the entirety of the film once they get into the race itself. When you see all that Arthur endures and the bond that forms between him and Mikael along with the other teammates - it makes your soul sing with hope and wonder at the willpower of this dog and how he serves as a living mascot for the rest of the team. Mark Wahlberg did a fantastic job acting the part of Mikael but when I saw he also produced I was thrilled because the execution of every scene and how it ties to the love and courage of an amazing dog was beautifully delivered.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10720352/?ref_=sr_i_46

The Witcher,8.0,"['Freya Allan', 'Henry Cavill', 'Anya Chalotra', 'Eamon Farren', 'Mim√Æ M Khayisa']",Creator,2019.0,adventure,"Watched both seasons when they came out.Liked the first season, unlike lots of people also liked the added Yennefer content. Didnt mind the chronological jumps but I understand that it might be somewhat confusing for some people. However in my opinion the solution to this was not to switch to a linear story, but to make the chronology and the flashbacks more accesible.Sadly I have to agree, with the backlash to the second season, especially the backlash from the book fans. The writing team abandoned its source material, and replaced it with a very shallow, very generic fantasy plot already seen in dozen of fantasy series. Some characters are way off, also in regard to the way they were established in season 1. There is no promised ""grey morality"" or moral questions, its very bluntly communicated, who and what is to be considered ""good and evil"". Its also quite boring.It seems at this point, netflix bought the brand name ""The witcher"", but decided to make its own thing to fit the casual audience, with flashy visuals.Marvel light.Its sad. The dark, harsh, cruel and unforgiving fantasy world of the witcher, with its rich characters with different motivations, interesting moral questions and plot inspired by eastern european folklore and actual eastern european history had the potential to be special, even as a sandpapered hollywood version.A lost oppurtinity.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/?ref_=sr_i_48

Felt like fan-made university project with a multi-million budget that was only spend on slow motion CGI scenes. I doubt that the extended edition will have more movie magic since this one already fails in every sense.Not even the world-building or the design felt worth watching since it felt like the characters were in costumes rather than authentic dresses. No scene composition gave the feeling of a profound world with deep history.Too many unoriginal ideas that were thrown together with the hope of ""Let's hope it will be the next movie success"".I wouldn't say that the actors were weak, rather the error or lack of writers in the writing process of the movie show how important dialogue, character building arcs and real emotional value are in movies rather than gross tasteless blood baths, torture, explosions and one-dimensional characters.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14998742/?ref_=sr_i_49
Invincible,8.7,"['Steven Yeun', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Sandra Oh', 'Grey Griffin', 'Zazie Beetz']",Creators,2021.0,animation,"Invincible takes the classic Image Comics series and gives us the best mature animated superhero series since Spawn: The Animated Series. Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.Invincible feels like an extension of the shows so many of us grew up with, and a maturing of the kinds of stories Bruce Timm started off years ago, without losing the sense of superhero fun. It's character-drama, action-adventure, 'cape-opera', and universe-making stuff that proves it's truly special.Invincible is must-watch television.

Wish,5.6,"['Ariana DeBose', 'Chris Pine', 'Alan Tudyk', 'Angelique Cabral', 'Victor Garber']",Chris Buck,2023.0,animation,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304740/?ref_=sr_i_2
Kung Fu Panda 4,6.4,"['Jack Black', 'Awkwafina', 'Viola Davis', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Bryan Cranston']",Mike Mitchell,2024.0,animation,"I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21692408/?ref_=sr_i_3

It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support.

Not only was the animation beautiful to look at, but the entire thing was so ridiculously absurd and full of life. The characters are likable and very entertaining, my favourite probably being Alastor. The writing was also spot on. While it may have relied a little too heavily on swearing at points, the whole concept of it being set in hell kind of acts as leeway for that, along with the cartoony expressions, sexual nature of some of the characters, etc. But there were certainly a lot of funny moments in this pilot, in fact I had a massive smile on my face the whole time Alastor was on screen. There was a clear emotional center as well at points, so it was nice to see an adult show that wasn't ONLY centered on raunchy comedy. The music and songs were fantastic too, filled with a lot of energy, helped by the amazing voice cast. All the voice actors/actresses did a superb job and no one slacked off in the slightest.

Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. ""D'oh"" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of ""The Best Episode Ever!"" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the ""Golden Age"" of The Simpsons.However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate.

The comments they make just have me in stitches. Peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does ""are just so brilliant they're retarded."" The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane as he provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour Glenn Quagmire and how he manages this range (particularly with singing) I just don't know. He deserves his two Emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense.The only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing.If you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/?ref_=sr_i_15
X-Men,8.5,"['Cedric Smith', 'Cal Dodd', 'Lenore Zann', 'George Buza', 'Alyson Court']",Creators,1992.0,animation,"I love everything about X Men. The animation is very detailed and atmospheric, and the character designs especially with Wolverine are quite sophisticated for the time. The action sequences, which never suspended disbelief and had some wondrous elements for kids and adults alike to savour, have a lot of fluidity in that regard. The music is wonderful as well, the intro is one of the coolest of any animated series of the 90s(and there were a lot) and the background scoring manages to be beautiful and haunting. The writing is intelligent, sometimes affecting and sometimes humorous, though any sense of conflicting emotions are equally convincing, while the story lines are daring and always interesting and the characters right from charismatic Wolverine, sexy Rogue to the appropriately antagonistic villains are very well-written and likable. The voice acting is always expressive and never felt stereotypical, bland or overdone. In conclusion, a superb series. 10/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103584/?ref_=sr_i_16
South Park,8.7,"['Trey Parker', 'Matt Stone', 'Isaac Hayes', 'Mona Marshall', 'April Stewart']",Creators,1997.0,animation,"Both cartoons and sci-fi have long been the only place where thought-provoking social commentary can take place, unmolested by censorship, and both are all too frequently dismissed because of their least important characteristics. South Park is an intelligent, humorous and thought-provoking show that is often ignored or decried by people who judge it only by the very things it deliberately throws in their face, such as profanity, simple animation, and graphic violence, because the creators know that people like this are easily offended by these things, and will always miss the point. The simplicity of the animation, for example, has been criticised by people who miss the point that it's deliberately meant to be simple, in the face of those high-budget major studio cartoons that are more concerned with using cgi and selling toys than having anything to say. Nope, this isn't a show for those who don't appreciate irony. The episodes tackle a wide range of issues, from 9/11 to violence on television to celebrity obsession to religion, through the use of comedy, which is usually the best way to handle such matters.The main characters are four children who are basically mouthpieces for their creator's opinions, expressing views that would sound arrogant coming from adults. Stan represents the liberal viewpoint, as does his friend Kyle, who as a practising Jew, allows opportunity for religious comment. Is the show anti-religious? No, but fundamentalists like to think it is. It has the essential message of 'believe what you like, but leave me alone'. And of course there's Eric Cartman, the ignorant foul-mouthed selfish redneck, and funny as hell. Sometimes I think he's there to remind us not to take anyone like him seriously. That and to provide a lot of the show's humour. Easily my favourite character. Other characters on the show usually represent majority/opposing views as the plot requires.Like any long-running show, some episodes are better than others, not all have something to say, and not all are funny. But creators Stone and Parker 'retool' the show periodically with new characters, and try to keep up with current events, and I enjoyed the latest series (8th) for these very reasons. I've watched since the beginning, but they're making an effort not to let South Park go stale.No doubt South Park will continue to be derided by those who think the most important social problem today is swearing, yet have probably never sat down to watch an episode. And beside them will be the offended parent brigade who still haven't learned that not all cartoons are for children. But the rest of us will still be here to enjoy it, hopefully exchanging righteous indignation for a few laughs and maybe a thought or two about the world we live in. If you've never seen South Park, don't listen to the hype. Watch it and decide for yourself. Hopefully you'll be glad you did.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121955/?ref_=sr_i_17

This movie is a sure bet for a fun family time.Such a relief to see an animation movie that is targetted at kids, but which can be be enjoyed by old folks as well. I applaud the writers firstmost for this achievement.

Basically a John Wick anime ripoff. This is not entirely a bad thing if well executed but so far it does not impress: the animation is top notch but the voice acting is ATROCIOUS. It definitely breaks the immersion. Also, the characters are kinda flat, we are 5-6 episodes in and I simply do not care for any of them, the vendetta motive of the main character is just not enough to make me excited.

It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully.

Kung Fu Panda,7.6,"['Jack Black', 'Ian McShane', 'Angelina Jolie', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Jackie Chan']",Mark Osborne,2008.0,animation,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.Boy, was I ever under-expecting.At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clich√©s, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/?ref_=sr_i_26

She's a scientist at the top of her field, a professor at a prestigious university, she is a Lesbian who lost her partner to a foreign conflict, a first nations person from Australia and an activist with a criminal record. The list goes on and on and on and on, but none of it, not even her sexuality is at all important to the current events they put just as much effort into presenting how horrible the world is just for it to be completely overshadowed by how horrible the Ark is.I don't know, I'll keep going because it is well made.

However, something kept gnawing away at my soul that wanted me to find out what happens next and 2 days later I continued to watch the first episode. By the time it ended episode 2 couldn't wait and subsequent episodes became too tantalizing I couldn't wait.

May be best to wait for this one to come out on DVD and keep it in mind for an Easter basket gift for next year.

The writing is smart and I like that the conflict in the story is based more on skill and wit than something like magic powers because it makes it more relatable.

Kimitachi wa d√¥ ikiru ka,7.6,"['Soma Santoki', 'Masaki Suda', 'K√¥ Shibasaki', 'Aimyon', 'Yoshino Kimura']",Hayao Miyazaki,2023.0,animation,"Not his best, but a very solid fairy tale from the master with lots of his trademark elements like stoic characters, spirit worlds, flying scenes and characters running through narrow passages.It is stylistically comparable to Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle, although a bit less epic in scope. Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of ""tacked on"". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587046/?ref_=sr_i_32

The composing in this movie is some of the best I've ever heard and it fit so well in the movie. The voice acting was pretty good too and I didn't think Chris Pratt would be any good as Mario but he was actually pretty good but Jack Black stole the show as Bowser as he absolutely killed his role. Charlie Day was great too as Luigi as he was probably my 2nd favorite in the movie. The only problem I have with this movie is it felt so quick and I wish it was longer and it's only 90 minutes.

Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves.

A movie that wasn't all that widely known until its surprise Oscar nomination over popular entries like TMNT, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Suzume, this decision has definitely sparked some conversation in certain film circles. I personally am happy with the decision to go with ""Robot Dreams"" as it clearly has been nominated for its merits rather than its popularity... which should always be the undeniable standard.""Robot Dreams"" is a well-crafted movie of simple ambitions, with a focus on themes of friendship, loneliness, and the passing of time. Helped tremendously by the animation medium, you get the feeling that the movie is extremely precise in its messaging and awareness - where the lack of dialogue and the vivid world it's set in are able to draw out our attention to focus on the conflict and emotions being communicated. The humor is multi-layered, and so is the story, appealing just as much to adults as it would to teenagers.It might be a bit of a slow watch at first for those who aren't all that interested in watching a dog bonding with a robot, but if you can patiently buy into the movie, it manages to make you care about it in a very rewarding way.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13429870/?ref_=sr_i_38

The story between sisters, rich and poor, loyalty and betrayal, peace and war, and everything in between.There's a common saying that LoL's big budget went into animation instead of balancing the champions in game, and this couldn't be more right. I did not expect this masterful level of animation. After each episode, they found more ways to wow audiences with amazing visuals and transitions. The fighting scenes were hard-hitting and jaw-dropping.Even though the series wasn't fully canon to the original lore, it's still an intense story that set up an interesting universe. Not gonna lie, the first act didn't impress me too much, but episode 4 afterward got me entirely on board. My only problem with the story was that I just couldn't get enough of it. I wanted more and I don't like waiting.Just as cool as the animation was the characters. Many character dynamics fascinated me and made me realized how much I needed them. I'll admit that some characters were straightforward, but not all of them were predictable. Some still surprised me until the very end.

At the beginning it was really kid-friendly, but, years after year, season after season it started to be filled with quite gory/scary stuff I'd rather not show to a 6-7 years old kid. I don't think that's a negative side though, as this series managed to explain many empty points we had about either some events occurred in the movies, or the whole mysticism of the Force, a really good expansion of the saga -directly came from its inventor George Lucas - that helps fans understand better the star wars. As I already said, the series is not completely childish, and adults could enjoy it as well.Now, to the reason of why this didn't get a 10/10: the first season, and a few episodes we meet on the way that aren't really important story arcs. I must say that, despite season one is the only one I have on DVD, I don't really like it, has not many strong story arcs, as instead the other seasons have, also all seasons include several single episodes that are put just to fill the episode list.

We've watched every Kung Fu Panda movie, and we are definitely fans. The cast is incredible! Jack Black is awesome as Po, as usual. We particularly enjoyed the music score (which nicely emphasized the emotional parts) and the artwork. I appreciated that there were morals woven into this movie, especially with regard to finding your true self, appreciation of what it means to be a family and the importance of family, and Po's learning about chi, the life force in all living things. This all added depth to Po's character. There were, of course, many funny moments in the movie that made us both laugh. At the end of the movie (and we always stay to the very end, reading all the credits), the artwork was particularly beautiful, where they took images from the movie and made it look like an ancient, Chinese watercolor.

Cars,7.2,"['Owen Wilson', 'Bonnie Hunt', 'Paul Newman', 'Larry the Cable Guy', 'Cheech Marin']",John Lasseter,2006.0,animation,"There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.Revised thoughts, nearly three years later:My boys are absolutely bonkers for Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater right now, but had never actually seen the movie. Needless to say, they loved it, and I discovered that my own opinion has softened over time. Of course, it still can't hold a torch to the innocent humor of Toy Story, the sentimentality of Monsters, Inc. or the pulse-pounding twists of The Incredibles, but it fits in snugly on the second tier alongside A Bug's Life and Ratatouille. The theme may have seemed transparently concocted to sell merchandise, but as a product of the era when Pixar didn't do anything they didn't believe in, it still resonates with thoughtful care and well-placed emotion. Perhaps unfairly cast aside at first, it's a well-made, lovingly executed film that tugs shamelessly at the heart strings when its points bubble to the surface. I'd upgrade my score from 7 to 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/?ref_=sr_i_43
Futurama,8.5,"['Billy West', 'John DiMaggio', 'Katey Sagal', 'Tress MacNeille', 'Phil LaMarr']",Creators,1999.0,animation,"Futurama is the whipping boy of modern prime time cartoons. Since it was made by the creator of the Simpsons it was expected to be exactly like it. Futurama had its own brand of comedic flair, which is absolutely hilarious. Bender, Fry, Leela, Hermes, Zoidberg, all of these characters are well thought out and work incredibly well together, on top of the fact that situations and anecdotes from previous episodes are brought up all the time, adding continuity to an already excellent series. I'll admit that I too was among the people crying foul when Futurama first came out, I didn't grow to truly appreciate it until it was put in syndication on adult swim, and more so later as I bought all the episodes on DVD. I don't think the world was ready for what futurama had to offer when it first came out, and everyone should give it another shot through adult swim or by DVD rental. It has solid entertainment value, and a unique comedic style.4.5 out of 5 stars",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/?ref_=sr_i_44

The animation industry has been going through so much these days. You have the news that the MCU is overworking, they're animators. Do you have the news that the owl house is getting cancelled. And the fact that animation is struggling so much means that we should at least give props to the independent animation because they are making animations that would've never been made if they were under a TV network and I generally want you all to support shows like.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10691770/?ref_=sr_i_45

Next to Squidward is a large rock, where dwells a starfish with about as much intelligence as his home-sweet home. He is Patrick Star, neighbor to Squidward, but lifelong friend to Spongebob. Over yonder lives a 'land squirrel' by the name of Sandy Cheeks. Her hobbies include the search for the 'Hay in the Needlestack', to biking in the Industrial Park. Finally there's Mr. Eugene H.

Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,8.6,"['Daveigh Chase', 'Suzanne Pleshette', 'Miyu Irino', 'Rumi Hiiragi', 'Mari Natsuki']",Hayao Miyazaki,2001.0,animation,"There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in Western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, and fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams. Prepare to be Spirited Away......",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/?ref_=sr_i_48
Moana,7.6,"[""Auli'i Cravalho"", 'Dwayne Johnson', 'Rachel House', 'Temuera Morrison', 'Jemaine Clement']",Directors,2016.0,animation,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164/?ref_=sr_i_49
Naruto: Shipp√ªden,8.7,"['Alexandre Crepet', 'Junko Takeuchi', 'Maile Flanagan', 'Chie Nakamura', 'Kate Higgins']",Creator,2007.0,animation,"I wrote this review because there was no updated review on IMDb.The first of Naruo Shippuden three seasons were alright they weren't bad but also they weren't that good They dragged the story too much the pacing was slow and by slow I mean really slow ,the battle scenes took several episodes where they can be done with one or two and that almost killed the show ,it's too bad because the story and the characters and very interesting. But after season 3 the anime improve in every aspect the no more slow paced story, spaced battles everything gets better animation, action scenes, sound track and especially the story , I mean it's like it's a totally different anime from what it's started(in a good way of curse) and up till now it keeps getting better and better.Story: The story have humor, action ,tragedy , romance and twists in it and the anime present it so well it makes it worth your while to bear with the first three seasons and some fillers here and there(which are not that bad).In case of characters: most of characters are well designed and easy to relate to ,even some of the Villains ,every characters is unique in his/her own way and have depth.The animations are good...not the best out there but pretty decent for a TV series.Sound track is amazing and fits well in the scenes especially the fighting scenes.So eventually if you are a Naruto fan, you can't miss this anime, it started not that good but it became one of the best anime I've watched. I gave it 9/10 despite the disappointing slow paced first three seasons (~70 episodes)because afterward it gets so good that it covers it up the mess in the first 3 seasons.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988824/?ref_=sr_i_50

This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

Billy was good as Sam, although her performance and the script didn't quite capture Sam's humour and her strengths that you can watch on longer interviews she's done. Rufus did an adequate job as Prince Andrew, certainly with replicating the trainwreck interview sequence but I feel they could have touched on a bit more of his repulsiveness - however, the story is, afterall, from Sam's point of view.

This is a deeply affecting story of selfless people who did everything they could to save as many people as possible whilst others just ignored what was going on.Anthony Hopkins is on terrific form here. He embodies the selflessness effortlessly and brings a heartbreaking sense of defeat, focusing on what he could've done rather than what he achieved. He's also one of the rare actors who can make you cry by bringing on the waterworks, when he cries you cry.In the flashbacks Johnny Flynn is an extremely convincing younger version of Hopkins with that same desire to always do more. Helena Bonham Carter gets a loveable role supporting Flynn with a stern determination and refusal to take no for an answer.James Hawes directs with a level of technical competency that's designed to go unnoticed. The production value is reminiscent of a high end BBC production, which is obviously very fitting and the pacing is really strong.

Back to Black,6.4,"['Marisa Abela', 'Eddie Marsan', ""Jack O'Connell"", 'Lesley Manville', 'Juliet Cowan']",Sam Taylor-Johnson,2024.0,biography,"""Back to Black"" delivers a heartfelt tribute to Amy Winehouse, brilliantly capturing the essence of an icon whose talent and personal struggles left an indelible mark on the music world. This film doesn't merely navigate through the vibrant life Amy led amidst Camden's gritty charm; it delves deep, portraying not just her artistic brilliance but also her profound vulnerabilities. It masterfully showcases the overwhelming pressures of fame and scrutinizes the relentless nature of the celebrity machine, presenting a narrative that's as compelling as it is heart-wrenching. This isn't just a recount of a music legend's life; it's an invitation to see beyond the performer to the person, offering a richly nuanced appreciation of her life, her sharp wit, and her brutal honesty.Marisa Abela's portrayal of Amy is captivating, embodying the singer's raw and fragile essence in a performance that's incredibly authentic. She brings to life Amy's desperate longing for love and acceptance, along with her profound sense of loneliness, making her portrayal deeply resonate. Abela's Amy is not just a public figure but a person seeking connection in a world that often feels cold and unforgiving. While the film does dwell on the more tragic aspects of Amy's story, including her struggles with a toxic relationship, it's this exploration of her search for love and the stark loneliness she faced that adds a profound layer of depth to the narrative. The movie, despite its flaws and sometimes narrow focus, manages to strike a chord, particularly for those moved by Amy's music or touched by her life story. ""Back to Black"" might not capture every nuance of Amy's life with perfect clarity, but it's a deeply moving portrayal that echoes the bittersweet reality of her extraordinary yet tragically short journey.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21261712/?ref_=sr_i_8
The Boys in the Boat,6.9,"['Joel Edgerton', 'Callum Turner', 'Peter Guinness', 'Sam Strike', 'Thomas Elms']",George Clooney,2023.0,biography,"... Merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream ...A huge bestseller when it was published in 2013, Daniel James Brown's ""The Boys in the Boat"" was a big hit in my circle of friends. The kind of book that gets recommended, if not passed around, pal to pal.Set in the '30s it was the true story of the University of Washington junior varsity rowing team who not only gunned down the storied, legacy crews of California and Ivy League colleges, but went on to the 1936 Olympics in Adolf Hitler's Berlin. It was an adrenalized page turner, a movie waiting to happen.Now that it's getting to the screen, it helps to have George Clooney in the director's chair. Although he stays offscreen, the double-Oscar-winning actor, producer and director is the biggest name on the project.It's his face - generally recognized as one of the coolest guys on the planet - in many of the production stills and the ""for your consideration"" ads targeted at industry voters this awards season. George and co-producer Grant Heslov also took part in a recent Zoom press conference for the film along with cast members Joel Edgerton, who stars as taciturn coach Al Ulbrickson; Callum Turner, who plays team member Joe Rantz; and Hadley Robinson, who lights up the screen as Joe's sweetheart, Joyce.Opening in theaters Christmas Day, it's a feel-good throwback to old-fashioned moviemaking.Taking place during the Great Depression, the scrappy kids at their oars offered glimpses of optimism and hope, rare commodities in those tough times. Rowing was a popular spectator sport in that pre-ESPN era with spectators lining river banks and in some cases following the action in train cars on the shore keeping pace with the sleek 8-man wooden shells slicing through the water.Not just an incredibly demanding sport, rowing was a culture, too. The rowing world was made of wood - not just the glossy racing shells, but also their big-doored, high-ceilinged boat houses. You can almost smell the resins and varnish coming from the boathouse surrounded by lush forest on the Seattle campus.As the team keeps achieving more success, the gorgeous historically recreated settings move, first to colleges on the East Coast before heading for swastika-adorned Germany. Legendary speedster Jesse Owens was another member of the U. S. Olympic team that year. During the press conference Clooney acknowledged borrowing camera angles from Hitler's propagandist Leni Riefenstahl for the climactic Olympic rowing scenes.""We like to use Nazis whenever we can for filming,"" he joked.The mood was light during the Zoom press conference, now that the film was in the can and the cast's arduous training was long past.London-born actor Turner, whose Joe Rantz is as close as the eight-man team can get to having a hero, acknowledged that he hadn't had any previous rowing experience.""None of us had actually. And we turn up in February, and we get on the river. And it's snowing. And we're all in the tight shorts and freezing cold and have no skill at being in the boat. And after about three weeks, George and Grant come down to have a look and check in on us. We weren't in a good place. And I could see the pain behind the smile on George's face.""
""That wasn't pain. That was fear,"" corrected Heslov.The boys on the real team hadn't had any experience, either. For Joe and several teammates, making the team - beating the scores of hopefuls for the eight seats (plus the coxswain) - meant getting room and board at the university.Unlike Ivy Leaguers born to the sport, the junior Huskies were rough hewn. ""They were lumberjacks,"" said Clooney. They came together as a team ""out of necessity, out of hunger, out of having nothing else.""
The actors trained together for five months. Unlike their competitors in the film in new fiberglass shells, their boat, the Huskie Clipper, was made of wood like the original. Beyond just acting, there was a sense of athletic accomplishment for Turner and his teammates.""The hardest part about rowing is that you all have to be in complete unison,"" said the actor. ""There's no, like, hiding. And if one person is out by a millimeter, the boat suffers.""
For his part, Clooney faced a different set of challenges.""The oars are, you know, 15 feet long. And then the boats are 40-some feet long. So, you can't get close to the boats with the camera. And you can't get side by side or ahead of the boats with your camera boat, 'cause you'll capsize the boat. So, we had to come up with a design to get in tight enough to make it exciting. Meaning, we're on an 80-foot arm on the boat with a 300-millimeter lens, 200-millimeter lens, down low, getting wet, trying to hold focus while you're doing that. So, there was a ton of, like, math to try to make those things exciting.""
On top of that, neither Joe Rantz or Coach Ulbrickson were especially loquacious. They were men of action rather than words. On the printed page this is no big deal. On the big screen it can be. Hadley Robinson's feistiness along with her beauty, and Courtney Henggeler's portrayal of the coach's wife, Hazel, go a long way to humanizing their male partners.In a key scene, Joe and Joyce share what Clooney called ""a 1940s movie kiss"" - in a train station, no less. In a way, ""The Boys in the Boat"" itself is a 1940s movie. It's beautiful to look at, it wears its heart on its sleeve. It comes from an era when wholesome was cool. Standing up and cheering was nothing to be embarrassed by.But the psychological reserve of its characters played better on the page than they do on the screen.Despite Clooney's assured direction and the unbreakable spirit of the cast, neither the predictable script nor the soft sentiments of Alexandre Desplat musical score produce the irrepressible ""Chariots of Fire"" sorts of emotions that spell the difference between good sports movies and great ones.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856080/?ref_=sr_i_9

I binged it and now I miss Rocco and the series. I strongly recommend it. More than it says on the tin.Each episode has depth and ads a lot to the story, you really feel like you are following a person and a family through an entire life. You also feel the agony and the despair, you really feel for Rocco and love him deeply. The female characters are strong and give a feminist perspective without diminishing the male characters.

Napoleon,6.4,"['Joaquin Phoenix', 'Vanessa Kirby', 'Tahar Rahim', 'Rupert Everett', 'Mark Bonnar']",Ridley Scott,2023.0,biography,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13287846/?ref_=sr_i_11
Bob Marley: One Love,6.4,"['Kingsley Ben-Adir', 'Lashana Lynch', 'James Norton', 'Tosin Cole', 'Umi Myers']",Reinaldo Marcus Green,2024.0,biography,"Bob Marley: One Love is a thoroughly generic biopic told in an entertaining fashion. It starts off with an interesting idea focusing on a specific part of Marley's life and honing in on the unifying power of his music before quickly becoming the kind of biopic that's been done so many times before, frustratingly saving the most powerful moment for the archive footage at the end.Even when this genre is at its blandest the central performance is rarely the problem and that's absolutely the case here. Kingsley Ben-Adir gives a wonderful performance that never strays into parody and is the only time the film comes close to making Marley feel human. It's also great that Lashana Lynch is given so much, supporting whilst still getting some spotlight.Reinaldo Marcus Green's direction ends the film a little too early and uses a flashback heavy structure to hit all the required beats but it's all done in a technically competent and very serious way which helps. The soundtrack is obviously a major highlight however the score by Kris Bowers is an unexpected highlight thanks to its very dramatic nature.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8521778/?ref_=sr_i_12
Feud,8.4,"['Jessica Lange', 'Alison Wright', 'Naomi Watts', 'Susan Sarandon', 'Diane Lane']",Creators,2017.0,biography,"Now already on episode 3 I can say without a doubt. ""Feud"" is totally addictive. The writing, the direction, costumes and production design, it all works beautifully, satisfying those who knew nothing about the story and those of us who knew a great deal. The biggest surprise, however is the Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon's performances that puts everything into a level way above, camp and/or caricature. Their performances are serious, profound, all consuming. Two modern stars throw themselves into the emotional investigation of two stars from the past and the results are, let me say it, extraordinary. I'm looking at Joan Crawford through an entirely new perspective. Jessica Lange has humanized her without embellishing her and Susan Sarandon plays with Bette Davis's contradictions making them crystal clear even finding a sort of justification for them. I saw the 3rd episode ""Mommie Dearest"" twice in a row. That's how riveted I was and still am. Let me also mention Alfred Molina as Robert Aldrich. Sensational.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1984119/?ref_=sr_i_13

The Greatest Story Ever Told,6.6,"['Max von Sydow', 'Dorothy McGuire', 'Charlton Heston', 'Michael Anderson Jr.', 'Carroll Baker']",George Stevens,1965.0,biography,"Without a doubt, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the most difficult story to ever put on the screen.  More blood and ink have been spilled over this one man than any other human being that ever walked this planet, so there really can't be a definitive film on his life that will satisfy everyone.  But during the first half of the 1960s, director George Stevens (A PLACE IN THE SUN; SHANE; GIANT) toiled to at least come close in that regard.  The result was THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.  At a cost of twenty million dollars, it was one of the most expensive films Hollywood had released in that era.  At an original length of four hours and twenty minutes, it was one of the longest movies ever.  It was also critically savaged and was only a modest commercial success, though not an expensive flop like CLEOPATRA had been.Although it doesn't stick to ALL the facts of the Good Book, GREATEST STORY does an exquisite job at depicting Jesus life and persecution, his miracles, his death, and his eventual resurrection.  Utilizing a massive tome of a script that he co-wrote with James Lee Barrett and Carl Sandburg, among others, Stevens filmed much of the film on location in the Glen Canyon region along the Arizona/Utah border, with the Colorado River as a stand-in for the River Jordan (a move for which Stevens was sharply criticized). Aided by veteran cameraman Loyal Griggs (THE TEN COMMANDMENTS), he also shot scenes in this movie that must rank as being among the most brilliantly filmed ever, including Lazarus' resurrection, and Jesus' being baptized in the River Jordan by John the Baptist.One particular aspect about GREATEST STORY that continues to raise eyebrows and much ire to this day is the fact that Stevens cast much of Hollywood's acting elite in what were essentially walk-ons.  This tactic had been done extensively before (THE LONGEST DAY; HOW THE WEST WAS WON), and would be done countless more times in the ensuing decades.  To me, the flaw in this technique insofar as this movie goes is not the fact that Stevens succumbed to that temptation, but the fact that the roles he placed some of his actors in were ones they probably weren't cut out to play.Given the whole weight of the world being placed on him, Max von Sydow did quite an impressive portrayal of Jesus in this film.  I would have to rank this as one of the single greatest performances in cinematic history; his credibility (even with the Swedish accent) in the role is, to me, unimpeachable.  Stevens also scored by giving Charlton Heston (no stranger to Biblical epics he) the role of John the Baptist, and it still ranks as one of Heston's best.  Telly Savalas, years away from ""Kojak"", makes for a chilling Pontius Pilate.  Claude Rains is a supremely nasty King Herod; and Donald Pleasance, with HALLOWEEN still a decade and a half in his future, makes for a deliciously unpleasant Satan.In other areas, Stevens' all-star casting ranges from sublime (Dorothy McGuire; Roddy McDowall; Sidney Poitier; David McCallum; Jose Ferrer; Victor Buono) to strange (Russell Johnson; Jamie Farr; Sal Mineo; Shelley Winters). But it is in his casting of John Wayne as a Roman centurion at the Crucifixtion that Stevens went overboard (thus the reason for my giving GREATEST STORY an '8' rather than a '10').  To this day, it's hard not to notice the Duke looking out of place as a Roman, and harder still not to groan at the flat way he utters his line (""Truly, this man was the Son of God"").Still, despite the slightly questionable casting and the obvious extreme length of the film, Stevens has indeed fashioned as great a film as there has ever been on a story that has fascinated, frustrated, and even torn the world apart for over two thousand years.  How others view it is up for themselves to decide.  I myself think that, though slightly imperfect, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD still lives up to its title.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059245/?ref_=sr_i_15
Ferrari,6.5,"['Adam Driver', 'Shailene Woodley', 'Giuseppe Festinese', 'Alessandro Cremona', 'Derek Hill']",Michael Mann,2023.0,biography,"Saw this at the Viennale in Vienna today.Penelope Cruz is a gem as Laura. Woodley somehow plays the same character in everything she's cast in. I think she's got talent, but how can you tell at this point? Driver was okay. The bad accents by the American actors took a while getting used to, but at 135min, there is plenty time for that.The real stars were the cars and the driving scenes of course - and they were absolutely stunning!I'm not a big action movie person, but these scenes were so well done, I'd get into the Fast & Furious franchise if it was done by this crew.As far as the story goes: it's well done, there is enough meat there in Enzo's personal life and the goings-on around the infamous '57 Mille Miglia that audiences who aren't only going for the car race will be satisfied.But Penelope Cruz carries the non-car-stuff on her shoulders, really. She's a powerhouse actress and for some reason I seem to forget it time and time again until I see another movie with her in it and am surprised at how good she is. I shouldn't be surprised - nobody should be. She's always great... but here, she's at the top of her game.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3758542/?ref_=sr_i_16
The Wolf of Wall Street,8.2,"['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Jonah Hill', 'Margot Robbie', 'Matthew McConaughey', 'Kyle Chandler']",Martin Scorsese,2013.0,biography,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/?ref_=sr_i_17
Cabrini,7.9,"[""Cristiana Dell'Anna"", 'John Lithgow', 'David Morse', 'Giancarlo Giannini', 'Romana Maggiora Vergano']",Alejandro Monteverde,2024.0,biography,"Mother Cabrini is a legend and I'm shocked that I had never heard her story before! This movie tells of her struggles and triumphs in such a beautiful, inspiring, and compelling way!After watching I not only wanted to research more about what she did in her life, but also the area of Five Points in New York City. Historically I felt enriched, but also I felt an overwhelming empathy for my fellow man and the struggles people are going through. Cabrini helped orphans and immigrants with nothing more than faith, believing the resources would come.

Spartacus: Blood and Sand,8.5,"['Andy Whitfield', 'Lucy Lawless', 'Manu Bennett', 'Daniel Feuerriegel', 'Peter Mensah']",Creator,2010.0,biography,"I can't stand much of whats on TV. What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).As a previous rater stated, the characters have shades of evil and good. Their ethics seems to match what values were imbedded in the roman civilization. The reason there is so much blood and it over indulges is because the show not only explicitly includes sensual dialogue, but the way it is directed and the tactics of capturing violence and glory are not 2D and speak to its sensuality. Bottom line: if you are a passionate person, you will enjoy the dramatic dialogue and poetry, the sexuality, and the brutality.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442449/?ref_=sr_i_19
La sociedad de la nieve,7.8,"['Enzo Vogrincic', 'Agust√≠n Pardella', 'Mat√≠as Recalt', 'Esteban Bigliardi', 'Diego Vegezzi']",J.A. Bayona,2023.0,biography,"I first read 'Alive' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I've read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of 'Alive' isn't about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there's that word again: IMAGINE) what it must've been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I'm starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I'm trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That's key here. How do you imagine that? You can't really, if you didn't experience it.Imagine...
In 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven't seen it, don't bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn't capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of 'Alive.' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn't sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn't change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular 'famous rock' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...
You cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn't go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won't let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...
And then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film 'Society of the Snow' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I've now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won't find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...
And of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the '93 film you would know that didn't look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn't win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn't ""I'm Ethan Hawke and I won't grow a beard"" bs. These actors literally look like they've been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that's why we're at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I've been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn't a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary ""The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn't believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did."" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn't need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I'm glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I've waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don't leave this film without it having an impact on you. It's not fiction.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16277242/?ref_=sr_i_20

Jesus of Nazareth,8.5,"['Robert Powell', 'Olivia Hussey', 'Laurence Olivier', 'James Mason', 'Anne Bancroft']",All cast & crew,1977.0,biography,"There has been no other biblical film that touched me like this one. Dispite all the little details that have been criticized and pointed out, these should be of no consequence.  The illustration of Jesus' life story in this film was rich.  Not only can you feel the strong presence of Christ through Robert Powell, but you also can get a taste of the times in which he lived.Although the film, like many biblical films, tries to clearly depict the spiritual nature of Christianity, this one goes beyond that.  It gives you a glimpse into the politics, social/religious hierarch, economics, and the mindstate of the Jewish and Roman communities throughout the era.  It's more than just your typical Christ film. It's gives you a broader view and a complete understanding of what it was like to live in the times of Jesus Christ.Besides being a historical landmark and the great religous story that it is, this film also takes you through the ups and downs. The doubts, the hardships, the miracles, and the uprising. A very 3 Dimensional drama.I am a Christian, and while I might not be as devout as some, my faith is strong and this film re-enforced that spirituality.  It was very moving to hear the lessons and wise preachings of Jesus in a similar setting to the one where he once stood.  To see the dramas first hand, from an unbiased point of view.I would advise everyone to see this movie atleast once. No matter if your a Christian or not.  The morals and lessons taught by Jesus Christ can be appreciated by anyone.  Not just as the Son Of God, but as a Man who strongly believed in Love and goodwill towards his fellow Man. Not only as a religious icon, but as a mentor, moral activist, and humanitarian to his people. His words are universal.  What he stood for is greater than any man that ever walked the face of this Earth.  This film gives you that insight. It goes farther than showing you a religious belief...it gives you the reason why it's worth believing in.I give this film 9/10.  Powerful, Enlightening, and Emotionally driven. The Greatest Story Ever Told dramatized for all to enjoy time and time again.If you liked this film, I also recommend ""The Robe (1953)"" and ""The Ten Commandments (1956)""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075520/?ref_=sr_i_24

The Gentlemen,8.2,"['Theo James', 'Kaya Scodelario', 'Daniel Ings', 'Joely Richardson', 'Vinnie Jones']",Creator,2024.0,comedy,"If that makes any sense. What I'm trying to say while pointing Aristotle's quote into a mirror, is that this is worth watching simply for all of the outstanding individual performances. There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.The Parts:#1 - The StoryOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.#2 - The DialogueRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.#3 - The CharactersBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.Compared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant.

She said she'd heard it was ""artsy"" and ""special"". Those words were a gross understatement.The setting is basically a fantasy and everything is off - but that's the point. It is gory but not in a disgusting way. There's a lot of nakedness.But god damn - the acting is the best I've seen for some time. Mark ruffalo and Emma stone are amazing in their roles and they're being pathetic and hysterically funny all the way at the same time but their progressions in terms of being pathetic run diagonally forward towards each other.I'm not going to recommend this movie to but a specific crowd of people though. It's not an attempt at pleasing a wide crowd. It's a vision by the director that's been clearly set forth and executed brilliantly and you as a viewer feel amazed that you get the chance to have a glimpse into this very weird mind that's written this. It's not a must see in terms of the story but in terms of creating art it definitely is.I loved it and felt disgusted at the same time. I was amazed and very troubled at the same time. It's a challenge to anyone who views it to open up all pre-conceived notions and completely throw them overboard. Be prepared to accept the dichotomies of the world for what they are and experience all the ugliness you can imagine and you will be fine.But just to lay out how disgusting this movie can be at times - a middle aged couple walked out of the theatre approximately 15 minutes into the movie.

The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304740/?ref_=sr_i_4
Resident Alien,8.1,"['Alan Tudyk', 'Sara Tomko', 'Corey Reynolds', 'Alice Wetterlund', 'Levi Fiehler']",Creator,2021.0,comedy,"I didn't expect much going into this because you know how SyFy shows can be sometimes, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun this was! It had so many funny lines, shocking twists, interesting plot lines revealed and everything even in just the first episode! Plus the effects are nothing to sneeze at. What I've seen so far has shown the perfect balance of dark comedy, drama, and a wonderfully oddball sci-fi, all packaged into a small town setting, which is something I've always liked. So, great acting, great scripting, great filming, I was hooked from the first few seconds and would recommend. And I just really like Alan Tudyk and truly think this show has a lot of promise.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8690918/?ref_=sr_i_5
Curb Your Enthusiasm,8.8,"['Larry David', 'Cheryl Hines', 'Jeff Garlin', 'Susie Essman', 'J.B. Smoove']",Creator,2000.0,comedy,"So what does Larry David do for an encore after the incredibly successful sitcom that detailed his experiences as a stand up in NY, he creates a new sitcom about his experiences as a very succesful creator of said show, post cancellation, living the good life with a ton of dough out in Malibu. Sounds pretty boring, and even snotty right? Its not at all. Like the rest of us, I loved Seinfeld, and still love the reruns. But I gotta say, this show is better. It's the same basic premise, which I guess is to turn a standup monologue into a situation comedy. In other words, instead of having a guy on stage telling jokes about the amusing and annoying happenstances of every day life, you create a format comedy, and use these anecdotes to weave together a plot. What made Seinfeld memorable was the clever way in which everything all in the end tied up in a nice little package. If you notice, that's a common laugh getter for stand-ups, to inject a joke they made earlier in their set and put it into practical anecdotal demonstration. You are right if you are thinking this is complete hogwash and hyper-analyzation of something not meant to be studied as such, but there it is. Having said all of that, I think CYE is the logical next step for fans of the Seinfeld show. It's the advanced course if you will of the more remedial network show. The freedom of HBO allows for obviously more adult material and language, but also for pure artistic expression. A lot of what goes on is definitely not palatable to the mainstream, and I could honestly see people hating it. Not me. I think its a rare chance to see genius, unfettered and uncensored. Yes Larry David was George Costanza or vice versa, but through this series, you also see he was Kramer, Elaine and Jerry. For some reason I totally relate to his inability to relate to everyone else, including his wife. Its often way too contrived, but I love it. If you were a fan of Seinfeld for the reasons I've mentioned, and not just for the run of the mill laugh track jokes, you will be missing something special if you don't give these a shot.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264235/?ref_=sr_i_6

Anyone But You,6.2,"['Sydney Sweeney', 'Glen Powell', 'Alexandra Shipp', 'Mia Artemis', 'Nat Buchanan']",Will Gluck,2023.0,comedy,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26047818/?ref_=sr_i_10
Kung Fu Panda 4,6.4,"['Jack Black', 'Awkwafina', 'Viola Davis', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Bryan Cranston']",Mike Mitchell,2024.0,comedy,"I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21692408/?ref_=sr_i_11
Monk,8.1,"['Tony Shalhoub', 'Jason Gray-Stanford', 'Ted Levine', 'Traylor Howard', 'Stanley Kamel']",Creator,2002.0,comedy,"Monk is one of the best new shows around. Tony Shalhoub plays Monk perfectly. Monk isn't your average detective. His wife was killed in a car explosion 3 year ago. He suffered a major breakdown and is now trying to get reinstated on the police force with the help of his private nurse. Monk's got lots of problems. He is Obsessive Compulsive, has fear of crowds, heights, the dark, and milk. Yes milk. Yet he is the greatest detective around. In one episode he even tried to straighten up the crime scene because the mess was driving him crazy.Here is a sample story. The chief described Monk's first day on the job in one ep. It was as follows:They were called to a run down hotel. A prostitute had ODed on some pills. Over a dozen cops said suicide. Monk said murder. They all thought he was crazy. The chief asked ""why murder?"". Monk points out that if she was commiting suicide where was the glass of water needed to get the pills down..He notices little thing no one else would.I give this show a 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/?ref_=sr_i_12
Wonka,7.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Gustave Die', 'Murray McArthur', 'Paul G. Raymond', 'Bertie Caplan']",Paul King,2023.0,comedy,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/?ref_=sr_i_13
Ricky Stanicky,6.2,"['Zac Efron', 'John Cena', 'Andrew Santino', 'Riley Stiles', 'Oscar Wilson']",Peter Farrelly,2024.0,comedy,"Is this a goofy over the top premise that takes way too much leeway with what our imaginations can do? Yes. Is it funny? Yes. I'm a 90's kid. This is one of those films that I would watch a few times when I rented it at Hollywood Movies. It isn't great, but it's good. It wasn't a waste of my time, and I love the cast. I hope that everyone involved is happy with this product, cause it made me happy.Obvious problems were mentioned earlier. You have to seriously forget how much tightrope walking that the characters have had to do (their whole lives) to make this whole thing happen.Good parts are that there is actually well written skits. John Cena is just ham enough to make the second main character and comic relief a true treat. There are jokes fired pretty rapidly if you sit back with this one.I liked it. If there is a switch in you that can turn off the ultra serious, watch this. If not, stay far away. This isn't an Oscar movie, and no one is Marlon Brando. It's a 6/10 movie.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1660648/?ref_=sr_i_14
Gen V,7.7,"['Jaz Sinclair', 'Lizze Broadway', 'Maddie Phillips', 'London Thor', 'Derek Luh']",Creators,2023.0,comedy,"I'm older so was very concerned this would be too YA for me, but I gave the first episode a chance and ended up watching all 3 released episodes. The show has the same feel of Boys, but a bit more serious and less outright comical - although there are some very funny bits.I see a lot of complaints about the lead actress - who is very pretty by the way. I see comments like she is unlikeable. However, if you watch all 3 released epis you will see her character evolve and evolve again. Give her a chance. Her power is quite bizarre. The manifestation of it is a horror. However, it has some interesting applications that one might not see at first until it is used. I believe her and the girl playing her roommate, are actresses to watch out for in the future.In fact, the young cast as a whole, all unknown to me, are very solid. The blond who dates Golden Boy (played by Arnie's son) stood out to me as well, as does the guy who plays the Magneto-like supe.Clancy Brown has a small but important role with this one soliloquy that was excellently done, and just evil.If you like The Boys, then I don't see why you would not like this show.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13159924/?ref_=sr_i_15

After ending ""The Good Fight,"" 2024 brings us yet another such spinoff of ""The Good Wife,"" one named for that show's kooky lawyer character named ""Elsbeth."" The Leap Day pilot episode sets up the show's clever premise: that her title character has been designated an impartial observer of the NYPD in a formal legal consent decree to hopefully ferret out any police corruption in the ranks. But in the meantime she cannot help but help those hapless officers solve their trickiest cases. Like Columbo's classic show, we are privy to the perpetrator's machinations, but get pleasure from observing the observer, Elsbeth, investigate and determine those guilty of the crime(s). Carrie Preston is outstanding in the lead role, and Wendell Pierce excels in the role of the NY Police Captain, who may or may not be on the straight and narrow himself.

Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_18

I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon.

I remember looking forward to the American version when it first came out and being disappointed immediately to the point that I refused to watch it after the first episode. Almost 6 years later I gave it another go as people were telling me that it was actually quite good. I took the advice that I should start from season 2. This time around I enjoyed it more and gradually warmed to the characters that were basically copies of the British version. I can't believe that I would ever say this, but this show is as good as the British version. The bonus is that there is a lot more of it. It was certainly a knee-jerk reaction to give up on it so quickly, but it seems that a lot of people did. The Jim/Pam relationship is a clone of Tim and Dawn, but some of the pranks that they play on Dwight(Gareth in British version) are quite brilliant.

On that score alone it's a delight, but not to worry, it goes way beyond that to flirt with opera-like heights of drama and beauty something quite appropriate given its setting in Sicily.Given the excellence of the acting and the seeming effortlessness of the story I would have to say Mike White, this series' creator, is some sort of unsung genius.

The Gentlemen,8.2,"['Theo James', 'Kaya Scodelario', 'Daniel Ings', 'Joely Richardson', 'Vinnie Jones']",Creator,2024.0,crime,"If that makes any sense. What I'm trying to say while pointing Aristotle's quote into a mirror, is that this is worth watching simply for all of the outstanding individual performances. There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.The Parts:#1 - The StoryOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.#2 - The DialogueRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.#3 - The CharactersBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.Compared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant.

If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015. Just goes to show that some people have no clue how to manage their expectations, and this site is no different. Look at what I've said, and now put it up against so many here...it's ridiculous.Like I said: watch it and make up your own mind. I avoided it for 5 years because of this site and I regret it. Season 2 isn't season 1, just like season 3 isn't 1 or 2. If you want the same thing over and over again, watch CSI.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/?ref_=sr_i_4
The Gentlemen,7.8,"['Matthew McConaughey', 'Charlie Hunnam', 'Michelle Dockery', 'Jeremy Strong', 'Lyne Ren√©e']",Guy Ritchie,2019.0,crime,"Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for ¬£400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8367814/?ref_=sr_i_5
Sugar,8.0,"['Colin Farrell', 'Kirby', 'Amy Ryan', 'Dennis Boutsikaris', 'Nate Corddry']",Creator,2024.0,crime,"I admit I have a soft spot for private detective drama's whatever the time frame and this looks to be a good one. The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16418808/?ref_=sr_i_6

Tony Shalhoub plays Monk perfectly. Monk isn't your average detective. His wife was killed in a car explosion 3 year ago. He suffered a major breakdown and is now trying to get reinstated on the police force with the help of his private nurse. Monk's got lots of problems. He is Obsessive Compulsive, has fear of crowds, heights, the dark, and milk. Yes milk. Yet he is the greatest detective around. In one episode he even tried to straighten up the crime scene because the mess was driving him crazy.Here is a sample story. The chief described Monk's first day on the job in one ep. It was as follows:They were called to a run down hotel. A prostitute had ODed on some pills. Over a dozen cops said suicide. Monk said murder. They all thought he was crazy. The chief asked ""why murder?"". Monk points out that if she was commiting suicide where was the glass of water needed to get the pills down..He notices little thing no one else would.I give this show a 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/?ref_=sr_i_7

Here, if you can relate to this wonderfully relatable character, every second of every moment is filled with tension because the Japanese culture is one of the most unique on the planet.

(I have seen thousands of films, submitted almost 2000 reviews here, and yet the most terrifying movie I have ever seen is Japan's 1964 ""Woman in the Dunes,"" which is not even a horror movie!)

So many subtle little thing that throw shade over both characters, thus showing such complex humans with flaws and virtues.Technically it does not stand out but it's servicable for the themes and story. Was this the perfect long-game psychological crime? That last scene speaks volumes. The last courtroom scene with the kid was devestating and conclusive, even if that lawyer tried to flip it. Even him knew the conclusion at that moment. It was cathartic.It was a very devastating and powerful film.

I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/?ref_=sr_i_11
Love Lies Bleeding,7.3,"['Anna Baryshnikov', 'Kristen Stewart', 'Dave Franco', ""Katy O'Brian"", 'Jena Malone']",Rose Glass,2024.0,crime,"My wife and I watched Love Lies Bleeding (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline follows a young woman who manages a gym in her small hometown. Meanwhile, a desperate homeless hitchhiker with dreams of becoming a bodybuilder arrives in town and forms a relationship with the gym manager. Their seemingly perfect life is disrupted when the manager's brother-in-law severely beats his wife, sparking a tale of revenge that spirals into deeper complexities.Written and directed by Rose Glass (Saint Maude) and starring Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Anna Baryshnikov (Dickinson), Ed Harris (Needful Things), Dave Franco (Neighbors) and Katy O'Brian (The Mandalorian).This movie excels in so many ways. The cast is impeccably chosen, and the costumes and portrayal of the 80s era are magnificent. The entire ensemble looks wild, especially Ed Harris. The film maintains a dark, gritty atmosphere reminiscent of a Netflix serial killer docuseries. The cinematography stands out with its elite camera angles, use of colors, and character delivery. The acting, particularly by Stewart, is outstanding, and the well-written storyline unveils deep subplots that are compelling. There's an opening toilet scene that almost made me gag, lots of pricks and the action scenes were intense and so well done. The corpses are awesome too. I will say the sex scenes were a bit much and overdone and the ending was a HUGE letdown. They took some liberties with the ending that was eye rolling and left me wondering why that was Glass' direction.In conclusion, Love Lies Bleeding offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a watch, but its failure to deliver a satisfying conclusion diminishes its impact. I would rate it a 6.5/10 and recommend see it at least once.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19637052/?ref_=sr_i_12

""The Sopranos"" has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, it's a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/?ref_=sr_i_13

After ending ""The Good Fight,"" 2024 brings us yet another such spinoff of ""The Good Wife,"" one named for that show's kooky lawyer character named ""Elsbeth."" The Leap Day pilot episode sets up the show's clever premise: that her title character has been designated an impartial observer of the NYPD in a formal legal consent decree to hopefully ferret out any police corruption in the ranks. But in the meantime she cannot help but help those hapless officers solve their trickiest cases. Like Columbo's classic show, we are privy to the perpetrator's machinations, but get pleasure from observing the observer, Elsbeth, investigate and determine those guilty of the crime(s). Carrie Preston is outstanding in the lead role, and Wendell Pierce excels in the role of the NY Police Captain, who may or may not be on the straight and narrow himself.

NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service,7.8,"['David McCallum', 'Sean Murray', 'Mark Harmon', 'Brian Dietzen', 'Rocky Carroll']",Creators,2003.0,crime,Great show for 15 years after that it went downhill. It started when Michael Weatherly left and went from there. From about the 2019 season onward it left its primary theme of military based crime investigation and started become a melodrama of horrible episodes about things like prison reform and side stories that had next to nothing to do with the military.

This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show.

To then find out the offender, not only didn't serve any time for his crimes, but went on to be employed by Disney working on another kid's program.It's a disgusting look at how the industry turns a blind-eye in keeping kids safe from these people.

Peaky Blinders,8.8,"['Cillian Murphy', 'Paul Anderson', 'Sophie Rundle', 'Helen McCrory', 'Ned Dennehy']",Creator,2013.0,crime,"In Peaky Blinders we follow a family after the First World War that is always looking for power and money. But a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family, but it's not easy. It will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like Italians, gypsies, local gangsters and Jews. Peaky Blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich, interesting and diverse characters. The fact that Peaky Blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men. But this is not true. The series also incorporates many powerful female characters. It has an excellent cast and script. Thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation. The film music is the highlight of the series along with Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy. The director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction.It is estimated that one episode of the series is worth 1 million and 1.5 million euros. This means a rich, detailed and beautiful work of art. Constantly supporting the narrative structure visually, Peaky Blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in Birmingham. Peaky Blinders, with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens, and contrasts with the shades of red, makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown, while attributing a distinct obscurity to Birmingham's misty air. Also, the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever. The visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series.Peaky Blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama. It's a breathtaking series where you can see the rise of Peaky Blinders. 9/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442560/?ref_=sr_i_22

I really wanted to like this new show and was eager to see it. After watching the first episode, however, I am extremely disappointed. It's just terrible. I don't think it's Justin Hartley but everything else about it: the other characters (all predictable, all caricatures, some terribly acted), and the plot (again, predictable and trite). Some other viewers have suggested Justin Hartley's acting is stiff and bad. I don't think so; in fact, I think he's pretty good in this. But that can't compensate for the banal script and terrible plot.

Dexter,8.6,"['Michael C. Hall', 'Jennifer Carpenter', 'David Zayas', 'James Remar', 'C.S. Lee']",Creator,2006.0,crime,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/?ref_=sr_i_24

Death in Paradise offers sunshine, fun and murder.We will all have our favourites as to best Detective and favourite cops, but each has had their moments, I've enjoyed them all. We've had some terrific episodes, my favourite story thus far has been 2019's Beyond the Shining Sea, it showed that years after it started it could still shock, entertain and remain hugely relevant, the show has never suffered fatigue or become stale.It comes as no surprise to me that it keeps on going. 8/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1888075/?ref_=sr_i_26

I believe I love this show as much as Breaking Bad because of the exact reason. I REALLY love how every character behaves and develops in this show. What more fascinating is, this show has everything you like from Breaking Bad. Tension, emotions, atmosphere, character flaws, good antagonists, you name it. One other similarity this show has, this show gets better when it is closer to the end.

Alan Ritchson is a great choice for the role of Jack Reacher, not only does he look like him, but he conveyed his character well on screen.Most of today's series is unwatchable, but this is a really positive surprise. The series follows the plot of the first book, ""Killing Floor,"" and Reacher tries to find the culprits responsible for a series of murders.The show is a real surprise, because it does not suffer from most of the common flaws of today's film production. There are only a few small things that could be better, but this is definitely better than the vast majority of today's shows, because it tries to entertain the viewer, and not bother him with unnecessary things.The fight scenes are excellent, tense and brutal. Alan Ritchson is convincing in the role of Jack Reacher, but the other actors also portrayed their characters well. A really pleasant surprise, considering that most good stories are ruined by today's writers.The show looks interesting, very cinematic and is well directed.

Simmons and Anna kendrick.Affleck's performance here's one of his best next to his amazing role in Gone Girl 2014 (which i highly recommend you to watch), he really brought to the character everything and show to us how people with autism live.the action scenes are the soul of the film, i enjoyed them very much especially ben's head shots they were very funny and enjoyable and his fighting skills were really amazing( i just which they had put a little more action to this film, but i guess due to the flashback scenes and the difficult story it would have become too difficult to focus.As for the brother role it was OK in the flash back but when it came to present time it was a little bit bad and the reason of it is choosing an actor who is totally different in race and physic and i just kept looking at him wondering what the hell they were thinking when they chose him to play the role (even his body figure was totally different from the child's body!) for me that was the only bad thing in this film.Final rate :8 out of 10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140479/?ref_=sr_i_33
Sherlock,9.1,"['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Martin Freeman', 'Una Stubbs', 'Rupert Graves', 'Louise Brealey']",Creators,2010.0,crime,"Sherlock is such an absolutely brilliant show! All you have to do is read through some of the reviews to see how loved this show really is. It's one of the best rated tv shows on just about every website for a reason...because it's incredible! There have been a lot of different versions of Sherlock Holmes with a bunch of really good ones (Robert Downey Jr., Jonny Lee Miller) and with some really bad ones but Benedict Cumberbatch is the best of them!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/?ref_=sr_i_34
Bones,7.8,"['Emily Deschanel', 'David Boreanaz', 'Michaela Conlin', 'T.J. Thyne', 'Tamara Taylor']",Creator,2005.0,crime,"David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel start well with better than two-dimensional characters in a fresh look at a CSI type show. Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show. Still some rough edges in writing and delivery (Tempe's ""I wish this was the worst I have seen"" was painful for all the wrong reasons),""Bones"" has great potential.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/?ref_=sr_i_35
Midsomer Murders,7.9,"['John Nettles', 'Jane Wymark', 'Barry Jackson', 'Neil Dudgeon', 'Fiona Dolman']",Creator,1997.0,crime,"The cases of Chief Inspector Barnaby, a respectable middle-aged family man and a good old fashioned copper and his young sergeant Gavin Troy who is rather touchy and immature and is always jumping to conclusions during investigations. All of the duo's cases take place in the picturesque yet fictional county of Midsomer which must have the highest death rate anywhere in the world!This highly popular detective series was first aired on 23 March 1997 when the pilot episode ""The Killings At Badgers Drift"" was transmitted. ITV announced it as a one off film but it was very successful with figures in the region of 13.5 million viewers, and the film won the Best Drama Award that year. The film was based on the 1987 novel by Caroline Graham which was regarded by the Crime Writers' Association as being one of the Top 100 crime novels of all time. The initial series which followed was based on Graham's other four Inspector Barnaby novels, these were ""Written In Blood"", ""Death Of A Hollow Man"", ""Death In Disguise"" and ""Faithful Unto Death"". Having filmed the majority of Graham's novels featuring Barnaby (A Place Of Safety & Ghost In The Machine have not been filmed as yet) the producers turned to other writers to provide new stories for the subsequent five series. These have included contributions from prolific and accomplished writers such as Anthony Horowitz (""Agatha Christie's Poirot""), Douglas Watkinson (""The Professionals"", ""Boon"", ""Emmerdale"") and Christopher Russell (""The Bill"", ""Cadfael""). In the past six years since it made its debut on British television there has been nearly thirty episodes and there is no hint of the series finishing yet. The series is notable in that it has brought John Nettles back to prime time TV after the ""Bergerac"" series finished in 1993. In this series he played Sergeant Bergerac, a Jersey copper fighting alcoholism and has had uncomfortable relationships with several girlfriends, a role far removed from that of Inspector Barnaby.The first episode of the seventh series entitled ""The Green Man"" was aired on 2 November 2003. Daniel Casey who plays Sergeant Troy has left the series. The character has been promoted to Inspector and is leaving Midsomer to take up a position in Newcastle. John Nettles will have a new sidekick in John Hopkins as Sergeant Scott who will be introduced when the remainder of the series is broadcast in January 2004.""Midsomer Murders"" is a wonderful series, although like many long running series, it has occasionally fallen below it's own standard in that the ideas for new plots sometimes becomes strained after so many episodes. The characters are rich and well realised by first class actors and it gets full mileage out of it's rural setting. Guest stars have included Alan Howard (the nephew of Leslie Howard) and Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny in all the James Bond films since ""Goldeneye""). The quality of this series to my mind is that it should make it to the big screen someday. There would be no need to change anything as all the ingredients for a good cinema feature are there already. These days most of the quality stuff is on the small screen and a lot of mediocre stuff is lumbered on our picture houses.It has been announced that John Nettles will be quitting the show after playing Inspector Barnaby for twelve-years since the show made its debut. However, he will still be seen in it until 2011 and it looks very much like the show will still continue very much in the manner of other TV shows such as Taggart and McCallam, which carried on without their title characters.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118401/?ref_=sr_i_36
Traces,7.0,"['Laura Fraser', 'Michael Nardone', 'Jennifer Spence', 'Andrea Hart', 'Molly Windsor']",All cast & crew,2019.0,crime,"I'm giving this 7 out of 10 because although I found it enjoyable, the actress playing Emma seemed so wrong for the role. As others have said, she looks too young, is monotone, and it felt more as though she was in an early rehearsal for the role rather than the finished product.I like Martin Compston and Laura Fraser, and have always enjoyed other productions when they are in the cast - and the actor playing the detective could flirt with me if he wanted to! Both seasons were good, I binge-watched it while working on a craft project, so being focused on that - plus the rest of the cast being good - was what probably helped me to stick with it despite the just-so-wrong Emma.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788012/?ref_=sr_i_37
Chicago P.D.,8.1,"['Jason Beghe', 'Marina Squerciati', 'Patrick John Flueger', 'LaRoyce Hawkins', 'Amy Morton']",Creators,2014.0,crime,"Chicago PD follows the Intelligence Unit as they investigated crimes in the city of Chicago. It's led by Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) who has a history of stepping over the line however he wants to get results. This series has a gritty feel to it that separates it from other police shows. The best thing about it is the cast (Beghe, Patrick John Flueger, Jesse Lee Soffer, LaRoyce Hawkins, Sophia Bush, Tracy Spiridakos, Marina Squerciati, Elias Korea's, etc.). It's one show of a bigger Chicago Universe that they created along with Chicago Fire & Chicago Med. I personally think Chicago PD is far and away the best of the 3 and definitely worth watching.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2805096/?ref_=sr_i_38
Killers of the Flower Moon,7.6,"['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Robert De Niro', 'Lily Gladstone', 'Jesse Plemons', 'Tantoo Cardinal']",Martin Scorsese,2023.0,crime,"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/?ref_=sr_i_39
The Wire,9.3,"['Dominic West', 'Lance Reddick', 'Sonja Sohn', 'Wendell Pierce', 'John Doman']",Creator,2002.0,crime,"I first attempted to watch this series over a decade ago when I started getting interested in films and tv shows in a major way, but I was still not mature enough to enjoy the more complex kind of TV I see that now. I used to think the show was boring, did not understand half of it, to be fair I am not from USA and some of the language in this show is a little too high level for a non native to understand from both the cops and drug dealers, even now I still don't get a few expressions they do or police terms. I guess I even hated it I only watched the first season and save a few scenes I was mostly boredNow I feel like my taste has matured a lot since I last saw it, decided to give it another chance, and now I see every scene, every dialogue, every line between the lines and I haven't even finished the first season again and I am loving it, maybe not yet as much as I love Sopranos or Breaking bad which are arguably simpler but very smart, real and entertaining. The Wire does feel more complex on its themes I guess it's too real in a way which is why I thought it was boring the first time, they bother with details normally other TV shows would skip or overlook.I still think Sopranos is better, it is easier to digest, but without losing that feeling of realism and being relatable on every level, but it doesn't make the wire any less important.I look forward to finishing it this time and maybe even update my review once I am all done.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/?ref_=sr_i_40
The X Files,8.6,"['David Duchovny', 'Gillian Anderson', 'Mitch Pileggi', 'William B. Davis', 'Robert Patrick']",Creator,1993.0,crime,"What can one say? The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, ""This isn't very scary..."", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the ""Mulder and Scully in love"" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns. Because I got to be there for the ride...and though it was often bumpy and is now coming to its end...I can look back and say, ""Hey, it was a GREAT 9 years.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/?ref_=sr_i_41
Death and Other Details,6.8,"['Violett Beane', 'Lauren Patten', 'Angela Zhou', 'Hugo Diego Garcia', 'Pardis Saremi']",Creators,2024.0,crime,"Today is February 6, 2024, and I just finally quit watching this series in the middle of the extremely boring 5th episode. I have to admit that I really enjoyed the series in the beginning. The first two episodes are quite exciting and stylish, but that's about it. The whole concept is stillborn, the characters are uninteresting and anonymous, the acting is unremarkable, the writing is boring for such a pre-designed genre as a huis-clos whodunit. The luxury yacht setting is embarrassingly d√©j√† vu, and all the characters look like plastic models from a home-deco ad. There is no sense of class struggle, which ultimately seems to be the theme of the story, as everyone looks like they could be having mai-tais on Wall Street during lunch. What's interesting about shows like The White Lotus or movies like Triangle of Sadness and Saltburn is how the creators are aware that everyone looks good as a statement, and because it's either that or the highway in such deluxe hangouts. This murder mystery seems to be ambivalent about a recognizable way to present the characters and totally unaware of a better way to do it. In the end, the whole story development is substandard and very unambitious. Kudos to the lovely Violett Beane as Imogene, witty and perpetually well-coiffed.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15439048/?ref_=sr_i_42
Baby Driver,7.5,"['Ansel Elgort', 'Jon Bernthal', 'Jon Hamm', 'Eiza Gonz√°lez', 'Micah Howard']",Edgar Wright,2017.0,crime,"I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/?ref_=sr_i_43
3 Body Problem,7.7,"['Jovan Adepo', 'Liam Cunningham', 'Eiza Gonz√°lez', 'Jess Hong', 'Benedict Wong']",Creators,2024.0,drama,"So thought-provoking. This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story. Watch this and enjoy it, but try to find the time to watch the original.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13016388/?ref_=sr_i_1

The atmosphere, plot, acting are superlative. The politicking and scheming are prime Game of Thrones but I hate making that comparison as I want this show to stand on its own. The scheming between the various lords and the Portuguese faction is titillating and suspenseful as we watch various characters play the game. I love it! I cannot wait for next week. I haven't felt this way about a show in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy top tier drama.Funny to see most one star review being uneducated people who complain about subtitles.Japanese should never be dubbed.

Dune: Part Two,8.8,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Zendaya', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Javier Bardem', 'Josh Brolin']",Denis Villeneuve,2024.0,drama,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/?ref_=sr_i_3
Ripley,8.1,"['Andrew Scott', 'Dakota Fanning', 'Johnny Flynn', 'Margherita Buy', 'Vittorio Viviani']",All cast & crew,2024.0,drama,"Andrew Scott gives a deeply neurotic and disturbing impression of one of the most beloved psychopaths in movie history. He's a great actor and he knows exactly what he's doing, sharp, precise, intense, on top of his acting skills.Zaillian stretches the story out here, (sometimes a little bit too much in the last three episodes), taking 8 hours, compared to shorter former versions. I must say I like all versions, because Highsmith's original story is of genius quality, and it allows to open a lot of doors to different interpretations. I loved Alain Delon in the Rene Clement classic, as well as Matt Damon in the luscious Minghella version, but comparing the different interpretations in detail would take to long.About this one: Yes, I loved that it was shot in atmospheric black and white (fantastic cinematography, every frame a piece of art!), I loved that this version was slow, I loved that it was so dark, I loved the sardonic humour.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me here.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11016042/?ref_=sr_i_4
Invincible,8.7,"['Steven Yeun', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Sandra Oh', 'Grey Griffin', 'Zazie Beetz']",Creators,2021.0,drama,"Invincible takes the classic Image Comics series and gives us the best mature animated superhero series since Spawn: The Animated Series. Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.Invincible feels like an extension of the shows so many of us grew up with, and a maturing of the kinds of stories Bruce Timm started off years ago, without losing the sense of superhero fun. It's character-drama, action-adventure, 'cape-opera', and universe-making stuff that proves it's truly special.Invincible is must-watch television.

The drtail and imagination that goes into making a film like this comes thru in a shocking manner. Finally we see a comedic dark twisted gilm that feature many great performances by actors who took alot of risks to even do a movie like this. Although it mimics Frankenstein at times the story twists into a twisted and sexual situational film about a woman finding her true identity in society.

Game of Thrones,9.2,"['Emilia Clarke', 'Peter Dinklage', 'Kit Harington', 'Lena Headey', 'Sophie Turner']",Creators,2011.0,drama,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=sr_i_9

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

Dune: Part One,8.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Zendaya', 'Oscar Isaac', 'Jason Momoa']",Denis Villeneuve,2021.0,drama,"This movie is big. It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.This is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.I would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.However, this is only ""Part 1"", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_=sr_i_11

There is no story line or investigation into motivations or character just some glib -""yeah I am going to try harder not to murder my patients with racism""Also Grey herself - how many times is this woman going to die?The Terminator would have called it a day by now!I swear she has her own parking space in PurgatoryThe security guards see her coming and just wave her through.""Hey, Meredith, what got you this time?

All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game.

As the oldest rookie he has to persuade skeptics that he's cut out for the job and that this isn't some mid life crisis.

If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015.

Palm Royale Really nails that time in US history.I am reviewing only the pilot here- I'm not even sure I like the show, but I am certainly impressed with the sincere and intelligent way it captures that which I recall of the times.Palm Royale presents itself as a sort of fairytale murder mystery with an outstanding cast.

Crew,7.8,"['Tabu', 'Kareena Kapoor', 'Kriti Sanon', 'Diljit Dosanjh', 'Kapil Sharma']",Rajesh A Krishnan,2024.0,drama,"Crew (2024) :
Movie Review:This Crew Needed A Better Flight To FlyCrew Review: Rajesh Krishnan surprised everyone with Tripling and Lootcase, and so the expectations were similar or higher from Crew. With three gorgeous ladies in the lead and never-seen-before aerial heist drama, this Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, and Kriti Sanon starrer was expected to fly high and even took off on a decent note, but unfortunately, the flight couldn't land safely. There was some unrepairable turbulence in the second half that took this exciting heist comedy down. A few comic punches worked because of adult humour and urban touches, but were they enough? Frankly, no, but they do pass on some good laughs. This Crew needed a better pilot, better training, and better study material than what it has to fly high. Let's say, air traffic jammed it.So, Crew can be called a wannabe parody of Vijay Mallya's scam, as here we have Vijay Waliya (Saswata Chatterjee), the owner of Kohinoor Airliner. We have three super hot air hostesses: Divya Rana (Kriti Sanon), Jasmin (Kareena Kapoor), and Geeta Sethi (Tabu), who are not getting paid enough and are struggling to get a respectable income. After trying all the right and honest ways of life, these three finally decide to join the dishonest gang at once by smuggling gold from India to the Middle East. Sooner or later, they were supposed to get caught, but what happens when they are looted by a rich man? These three must gang up to get what was ""ours,"" even though you have to turn a plain comedy into a heist comedy for that.Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri's Crew has a decent first half, but things crash down heavily in the second half. Parodying Vijay Mallya and his scam was okay; it was somewhat funny, but trying to capture him and seize gold was too much. The concept goes terribly wrong, and there are reasons for it. In the first half, you relate to the story because you can feel the struggle of those three ladies and their friends (crew members). However, the second half is not about them, so you lose all the connection and all the interest in the story.It's okay to take inspiration from The Italian Job and Oceans Eleven, but you don't have to drag those ideas into your fictional parody world by saying that it's all done for society's sake. The second half of Crew is full of loopholes. More holes (windows) than any plane can have. Nidhi and Mehul's sarcastic attempt at urban comedy is praiseworthy, but the comical sense was cheap. Nobody cares what's happening in the personal lives of those three ladies because they haven't had an inspiring or stable life. For instance, Divya (Kriti Sanon) is a topper, a sports champion, and always ready to fight the wrongs. She scares the hell outta referee for his wrong decision-that's more like it. But what happens to this smart, intelligent, and honest girl in the very next moment when she has quick sex with a stranger without any hi, hello, or even a formal introduction (forget love)? I never saw a dead man having a boner after death (almost after 10 minutes). You can't be serious, man. This is some next-level crap.I must say, Crew has plenty of glamour. Tabu hasn't been doing glamorous roles lately, except for De De Pyaar De, but here, she gets a complete new makeover. What a sexy makeover she has got here! The best and most aggressive dialogues also go into her kitty. Kriti Sanon is ""Kali"" (bud). She is young, dashing, and sexy, and she looks damn confident as an air hostess. Kareena gets into her Bebo mode again. Only this time around, you have to see her antagonising a few things. But then, she also has a few emotional scenes. Trupti Khamkar has done a fantastic job and will surely get your appreciation. Rajesh Sharma was a bit irritating in some scenes with those fake laughter and expressions, and the same goes for Saswata Chatterjee. I never could have imagined these two senior actors being wasted like this. Kapil Sharma had a sensible role, but with low screen time. Diljit Dosanjh has a somewhat interesting role, which isn't elevated well enough.Anil Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor have spent a nice budget on the lavish scale and look of the film. The costumes are exquisite, the locations are gorgeous, and the production design looks beautiful. Anuj Rakesh Dhawan's close-up shots of the three leading ladies are stimulating, but sometimes they expose the make-up they are wearing. That's scary. The music is tappy, as ""Choli,"" ""Naina,"" and ""Ghagra"" set the party mood right. Rajesh Krishnan's direction skills see a dip in quality compared to what he has done in Lootcase and Tripling, but more than him, it's the script that deserves to be blamed. Krishnan's over-the-top jokes can still take multiplex audiences on a roll, but they may not get enough support from the masses. Crew is a little screwed-actually very much screwed-in the second half, but there are some scenes that give you a little pleasure of new-age female-driven comedy. The rest of the show is strictly below average, and no oxygen mask can save you from that.RATING - 4/10*",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21383812/?ref_=sr_i_23

The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16418808/?ref_=sr_i_24

Wish,5.6,"['Ariana DeBose', 'Chris Pine', 'Alan Tudyk', 'Angelique Cabral', 'Victor Garber']",Chris Buck,2023.0,family,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation.

The chameleon seeks to use the staff Po received in Kung Fu Panda 3 to open a gateway to another dimension, summon kung fu masters, and steal their powers to become unstoppable. Simultaneously, Po must find his replacement to train as the next Dragon Warrior. Can Po save the world and find his apprentice simultaneously?Co-directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls) and Stephanie Stine (Major Motion Picture debut), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Viola Davis (The Help), Awkwafina (Crazy, Rich, Asians), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).The animation, animal universe, and the introduction of the new villain were excellent, as always. Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina's presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay. The film strikes a good balance between lessons and comedy, and kept us laughing throughout. While the ending was rewarding, it didn't quite match the brilliance of previous films in the series.In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series.

Wonka,7.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Gustave Die', 'Murray McArthur', 'Paul G. Raymond', 'Bertie Caplan']",Paul King,2023.0,family,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/?ref_=sr_i_4
Avatar: The Last Airbender,7.2,"['Gordon Cormier', 'Kiawentiio', 'Ian Ousley', 'Dallas Liu', 'Paul Sun-Hyung Lee']",Creator,2024.0,family,"As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_5

Avatar: The Last Airbender,9.3,"['Dee Bradley Baker', 'Zach Tyler Eisen', 'Mae Whitman', 'Jack De Sena', 'Dante Basco']",Creators,2005.0,family,"It seems rare for Nickelodeon to turn out a good new show these days, and even more rare for me to like an anime style cartoon, which is why I'm baffled as to why I love this show so much. Having not missed an episode yet, and having a reminder for new episodes on my desktop, I've seen that it just keeps getting better and better as it goes. Some of the story lines are predictable, but that doesn't turn me off of Avatar as it might some other things, which just adds more to my confusion as to why I love this show so much. Many kudos to Nickelodeon, this is easily greatest show since Rocko's Modern Life (IMO) and after Spongebob Squarepants, that is most definitely saying something!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=sr_i_8

I took a hiatus from K-drama because I don't feel what I felt during those dramas way back in the 2000s. Maybe because there's no spoiler back then. Anyway, as a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, he never repeats a role. At first, I got bored with his comeback drama, but after watching the first episode, I started to love his role as a husband. I also started to love Kim Ji-won as an actress. I hated her during The Heirs. üòÜ I could say that both of them have come so far. Going back to the drama, the story is not the typical love story. It's more about the feelings after marriage. As a married woman who had a failed marriage, you can feel the love between the couple that was hidden because of emotional exhaustion. After watching the four episodes, I started to understand the main characters and I couldn't wait for the next episodes, especially for the lesson learned about marriage.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27668559/?ref_=sr_i_9

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,7.6,"['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Emma Watson', 'Richard Harris', 'Maggie Smith']",Chris Columbus,2001.0,family,"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/?ref_=sr_i_11
X-Men,8.5,"['Cedric Smith', 'Cal Dodd', 'Lenore Zann', 'George Buza', 'Alyson Court']",Creators,1992.0,family,"It was this animated series that got me into the world of the-Men and other Marvel comics, which are far superior, but that is not to say this cartoon wasn't good, for it was. What we have here is the four core X-Men - Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey and Storm - along with popular characters from the comics - Rogue, Beast and Gambit - and Jubilee for the teens and Professor X as the basis for the series. Many mutants and other X-related characters make appearances through the series, some more often than others, and to varying degrees of likeness to their comic counterparts, (and Morph who was created specifically for the series). The X-Men are portrayed well to their comic-counterparts, with the exception of Jean Grey. Although it was this series that got me into X-Men, and made Jean my favourite character, in this series she was somewhat wasted, not used to her full potential. She was shown less-powerful than the others, when in the comics, she is one of the most powerful mutants in existence (even without the Phoenix Force). However Jean did get a few good stories, notably the ongoing Sinister stories, her and Wolverine's love subplot and the Phoenix and Dark Phoenix Sagas.But I digress. The villains were cool and in keeping with their comic counterparts, it would have been nice to see ones like Apocalypse and the Brotherhood more often. In terms of supporting characters, Bishop, Cable, Moira MacTaggert, Banshee, Arachangel, Forge and Colossus showed up a few times, but we could have seen more of Iceman, Darkstar, Polaris, Alpha Flight, Sunfire and Nightcrawler.A lot of the stories were taken directly from the comics and adapted for this series (like the Dark Phoenix Saga, Phalanx Covenant and Days of Future Past) others were taken from ongoing comic stories and changed into single or multiple episodes for this series, like the Savage Land and the Sentinels.There was some ongoing narrative, but it is also possible to watch episodes out of order, they were generally self contained (with the exception of multiple part episodes). It's cool to actually hear the X-Men speak and the costumes look cool on TV too. A great watch, most of the time.8 out of 10 for the whole animated series.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103584/?ref_=sr_i_12
Trolls Band Together,6.0,"['Anna Kendrick', 'Justin Timberlake', 'Kenan Thompson', 'Walt Dohrn', 'Anderson .Paak']",Walt Dohrn,2023.0,family,"A cinema full of children (and parents who had to accompany their children *g*). Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film. There will probably be few judgments in between. But children will be thrilled.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14362112/?ref_=sr_i_13
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,7.8,"['Gene Wilder', 'Jack Albertson', 'Peter Ostrum', 'Roy Kinnear', 'Julie Dawn Cole']",Mel Stuart,1971.0,family,"The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures. But ultimately it's the story and the way it appeals to every age group that makes Willy Wonka a prize treasure, the kids love it, while the adults watching with them will be wryly nodding and trying to suppress the onset of a devilish grin.Pure magic is Willy Wonka, see it now in High Definition TV to fully realise the dream/nightmare on offer, oh oh I love it so. 10/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/?ref_=sr_i_14

Migration,6.7,"['Kumail Nanjiani', 'Tresi Gazal', 'Elizabeth Banks', 'Caspar Jennings', 'Isabela Merced']",Benjamin Renner,2023.0,family,"I'll admit it, even though I am in my early 30s, I still enjoy watching animated movies, and animated shows. Sometimes I think there are certain things with animated films that can't be done with live-action movies, or maybe I'm wrong on that. Anway, Ok, Migration, the duck movie, or is it mallards the preferred word? No idea, not exactly an expert on ducks here, , anyway, I just saw it at my local movie theater, went to a 11:55 am showing, and I'll say this, I felt actually surprised. Does this movie do anything groundbreaking or anything that changes the landscape of animated movies going forward? No. However, I genuinely enjoyed it. Ok, maybe the plot is kind of simple, a few members of a duck family, including the mother duck wants to migrate, to explore the world, to see more outside their pond and see what more whats beyond her pond. The Dad duck, Mack voiced by Kumail Nanjiani , he has so many good lines in this movie. Mack is not really willing or wanting to explore anything behind his pond, his known ""comfort zone."" The mom duck , Pam, and their kids, Dax, and. Gwen help Mack understand reason they have to. And what happens next is a journey of encounters with friendly or not friendly other animals along the way, madcap adventures, getting lost a few times, along the way, an accidental visit to New York City and a wise-cracking pigeon leader, and so much more, which I promise I will not spoil for anybody who does decide to go see this in the movie theater. I personally had a good time watching it, made me smile, made me laugh, the animation is very good, I like the characters. Danny DeVito voices Uncle Dan, he is such a very funny, caring older Uncle and he usually says whatever comes to mind, he has some good lines too. Elizabeth Banks as Pam, mother duck , is a character who longs to explore a world outside her pond, and wants to have more experiences than just being stuck in one place, I liked her character quite a bit. Dax is a pretty awesome character, he is the younger duck, who keeps wanting to help his Dad and keeps wanting to explore try new things no matter the risk , but keeps getting told, not help, to mostly stay out of the way, until something he does at the end, not going to say anymore on that. And Gwen , is the sister, to Dax, oh my goodness, Gwen is super charming, a huge highlight of the movie I think. Gwen has this moment later in the movie, where she goes to her brother, Dax, and gives him a hug, and keeps hugging him, to comfort her brother, after Dax walks away from his family after something happens. It felt like something an actual sister would do to help comfort her brother, I think. Overall really enjoyed it, wasn't really excepting much going in to see it, felt genuinely surprised, very heartfelt and just a fun good movie. Two thumbs up. Or two webbed feet up?I think I should rank the animated movies I have seen this year,1: Boy and the Heron

Fox Network has created another hit series with ""Malcolm In The Middle"".Malcolm in the Middle has a stellar cast, intelligent writing & great direction. I'm sure some might find it hard to swallow the cutting edge writing. It's one of the first shows that has the characters actually saying what they feel and not thinking about it and some scenes like the father having his back shaved or the mothers breast could turn off some people. But, this is what makes ""Malcolm in the Middle"" fresh and funny.Due to those high-rated stupid game shows that have to give away a million dollars to get you to watch, this show may take time to catch on but all great shows usually do.""Malcolm in the Middle"" deserves to be around long enough to get into syndication.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/?ref_=sr_i_18

Kung Fu Panda,7.6,"['Jack Black', 'Ian McShane', 'Angelina Jolie', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Jackie Chan']",Mark Osborne,2008.0,family,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.Boy, was I ever under-expecting.At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clich√©s, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/?ref_=sr_i_20

May be best to wait for this one to come out on DVD and keep it in mind for an Easter basket gift for next year. There are a shortage of good, original movie plots out there, short on story line and imagination.

Kimitachi wa d√¥ ikiru ka,7.6,"['Soma Santoki', 'Masaki Suda', 'K√¥ Shibasaki', 'Aimyon', 'Yoshino Kimura']",Hayao Miyazaki,2023.0,family,"Not his best, but a very solid fairy tale from the master with lots of his trademark elements like stoic characters, spirit worlds, flying scenes and characters running through narrow passages.It is stylistically comparable to Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle, although a bit less epic in scope. Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of ""tacked on"". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587046/?ref_=sr_i_23

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I prefer the admittedly flawed film. Even the SFX in the film seemed better, and to check my memory, I rewatched the film after struggling to stay awake during the Disney+ series, and yes, those effects from 2010 survive the comparison. The early encounter with the minotaur, for example, feels more kinetic and dangerous in the film, while the TV version fails to convince that the adolescent Percy could in any way survive the encounter.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12324366/?ref_=sr_i_24
The Goonies,7.7,"['Sean Astin', 'Josh Brolin', 'Jeff Cohen', 'Corey Feldman', 'Kerri Green']",Richard Donner,1985.0,family,"I love The Goonies.  It is a classic 80s children-adventure film.  They don't make movies like this anymore... of if they do, its children hurting other children (Cruel Intentions... etc).  I do miss that from the 80's... during that time you can have an adventure film that relies on humor and ""monsters"" without an overt display of violence and sex like in todays ""PG13"" movies.  Anyway.. I rant...
I love all the characters from The Goonies.  Chunk is my fav (truffle shuffle, hostage crisis, Dead things Mikey! Dead Things!, and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis).  Its amazing to see the changes in Josh Brolin (Brandon) from back then to his performances today.I have this movie although it must be a edited version because I heard there was an octopus scene in the uncut version.. Haven't seen it yet.I heard they were going to make a sequel.. My question.. Why!?! Don't ruin a good thing. Leave it alone and walk away.  Resist all urges for a money-grubbing ""typical hollywood second release"" scenario.I love the music from The Goonies as I am a huge 80's music fan.

And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage.

Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.Invincible feels like an extension of the shows so many of us grew up with, and a maturing of the kinds of stories Bruce Timm started off years ago, without losing the sense of superhero fun. It's character-drama, action-adventure, 'cape-opera', and universe-making stuff that proves it's truly special.Invincible is must-watch television.

Think of shows like WEDNESDAY or XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS. Good production values, good acting, good writing. Now it is entirely up to you. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

Game of Thrones,9.2,"['Emilia Clarke', 'Peter Dinklage', 'Kit Harington', 'Lena Headey', 'Sophie Turner']",Creators,2011.0,fantasy,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=sr_i_5
Wish,5.6,"['Ariana DeBose', 'Chris Pine', 'Alan Tudyk', 'Angelique Cabral', 'Victor Garber']",Chris Buck,2023.0,fantasy,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304740/?ref_=sr_i_6
Damsel,6.1,"['Millie Bobby Brown', 'Ray Winstone', 'Angela Bassett', 'Brooke Carter', 'Nick Robinson']",Juan Carlos Fresnadillo,2024.0,fantasy,"I don't really understand why people expect masterpieces from every new movie release.Damsel is fun, entertaining, special effects are really good, better than latest summer blockbusters with bigger budgets (despite what IGN says) and the plot delivers exactly what it sells. This is not an indie Oscar Winner movie and it doesn't pretend to be neither.Stop trying to look for art in everything, like there are Bethoveen masterpieces and Tomorrowland EDM music to just jump around there are also movies to admire with all your senses and movies to enjoy on a Sunday evening.The movie is good and it doesn't deserve to be bashed because people were looking for another Schindler's List on it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13452446/?ref_=sr_i_7
Kung Fu Panda 4,6.4,"['Jack Black', 'Awkwafina', 'Viola Davis', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'Bryan Cranston']",Mike Mitchell,2024.0,fantasy,"My wife and I caught Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline introduces a new villain, a chameleon with shape-shifting abilities, aiming to take over the world. The chameleon seeks to use the staff Po received in Kung Fu Panda 3 to open a gateway to another dimension, summon kung fu masters, and steal their powers to become unstoppable. Simultaneously, Po must find his replacement to train as the next Dragon Warrior. Can Po save the world and find his apprentice simultaneously?Co-directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls) and Stephanie Stine (Major Motion Picture debut), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Viola Davis (The Help), Awkwafina (Crazy, Rich, Asians), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).The animation, animal universe, and the introduction of the new villain were excellent, as always. Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina's presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay. The film strikes a good balance between lessons and comedy, and kept us laughing throughout. While the ending was rewarding, it didn't quite match the brilliance of previous films in the series.In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series. I'd score it a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21692408/?ref_=sr_i_8
X-Men '97,9.0,"['Lenore Zann', 'Matthew Waterson', 'Cal Dodd', 'A.J. LoCascio', 'George Buza']",Creators,2024.0,fantasy,"This is the impression I got from just two episodes. This series deals with classic X-Men themes like prejudice, discrimination, hate, injustice, fear, and bigotry against mutants by humans again, but I felt like they were doing it in a more mature and improved way. I also gladly notice they didn't make a Wolverine show, and every mutant character is getting equal screen time and development, especially Cyclops getting what he deserves and shining as team leader. It's also welcome to see characters like Bishop and Morph join the X team. I liked Magneto's acceptance of Xaviers's human and mutant coexistence agenda and his decision to become a new leader of the X team because that made him a more three-dimensional and ambigious character rather than a one-note villain. This sequel is also very loyal and respectful to the old series and the nostalgic feelings of X-men fans. They are using the same character models, voiceovers, opening intro, closing outro, and music with improved and modernized animation. They didn't use the same opening stock footage intro from the first episode for the second episode's opening intro, adding new characters like Magneto and scenes to it, so obviously there is no laziness in this show. Overall, I got a very good impression from this reboot and sequel, and I'm looking forward to watching new episodes.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16026746/?ref_=sr_i_9
Wonka,7.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Gustave Die', 'Murray McArthur', 'Paul G. Raymond', 'Bertie Caplan']",Paul King,2023.0,fantasy,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/?ref_=sr_i_10
House of the Dragon,8.4,"['Matt Smith', ""Emma D'Arcy"", 'Olivia Cooke', 'Rhys Ifans', 'Graham McTavish']",Creators,2022.0,fantasy,"For me this is on par with game of thrones or in other words on the same level as 1 or 2 seasons of it. Meaning in my book, it's close to a 10/10 but for me is a 9.5/10 cause I feel as if the start was a bit slow but that does not mean it did not exceed expectations after a few episodes. The story was very well written & it's definitely one of the strongest spin off shows of any recent universe/series. The ending got me gassed for the new season & makes me wonder what we'll get in the future in the game of thrones universe. The acting was phenomenal & each character just like game of thrones, although some were annoying as hell, they were great characters. The time jumps weren't even confusing either.

It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first.

Avatar: The Last Airbender,7.2,"['Gordon Cormier', 'Kiawentiio', 'Ian Ousley', 'Dallas Liu', 'Paul Sun-Hyung Lee']",Creator,2024.0,fantasy,"As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_13

In Clone Wars some of the arcs were mature and amazing that build upon the movies and cannon, while some felt like dumb filler with no purpose!The same goes for this show, as some of the episodes are side quests, mainly aimed for kids, and some of the episodes contribute to the overall story, are more dark and mature, especially in season two, and aimed for the more mature or older audience who grew up watching The Clone Wars and the movies!I would say you dont need to watch every episode! Some of the filler episodes can be skipped and you wont miss out! I skipped some of the filler in season two and I enjoyed that season more than one!The animation though is amazing and that goes for every episode, even the ones that don't matter!

Interview with the Vampire,7.2,"['Assad Zaman', 'Jacob Anderson', 'Sam Reid', 'Eric Bogosian', 'Bailey Bass']",Creator,2022.0,fantasy,"To sum up this series, I will have to say it is beautifully done. If you enjoy, as do I, films and productions about Vampiric culture, then you will enjoy this latest take on Anne Rice's captivating book, ""Interview with the Vampire, originally published May 5, 1976. Her book was later made into a very enjoyable film in 1994, staring Tom Cruise (Lestat) Brad Pitt (Louis), with a commendable performance by a very young Kirsten Dunst. The rest of the cast truly shined, which featured Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, and Stephen Rea. The film, for the most part, generally matched the novel.This isn't true for this series. Indeed, it makes specific ""turns"" and takes certain ""liberties"" that are either not found in the source material or greatly exaggerated beyond the author's original theme. And while I initially felt it was not going to work, I changed my opinion by the end of the first episode. It works. Indeed, it works very well.There is no need for me to summarize the plot as other IMDb reviewers have already thoroughly covered it. I will say that the dark, often foreboding atmosphere found in both the book and the 1994 film, are very present in this series. It's not easy to take a ""classic piece of literature"" and mold it into an episodic body. I mean - Does the world really need another Casablanca or Gone With the Wind? In this case, I'd have to answer, ""Of course it does!"" You really can't have too much of a good thing, and when it comes to works like this, I find the different nuances and updates extremely entertaining. Give this a try. It is definitely worth your viewing time.No spoilers here as usual for me but I will reveal that during the time of pre-production for the 1994 film, Anne Rice was not happy with the choice of Tom Cruise. She felt he was far too conventional to play the pivotal vampire role of Lestat. Thankfully her opinion was ignored, because Cruise delivered an exceptional performance which she later enthusiastically acknowledged. On December 11, 2021, Rice passed away at the age of 80. And while she approved this series, it remains unknown if she was pleased with the casting of Sam Reid as the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, and Jacob Anderson as his lover and prot√©g√©, Louis de Pointe du Lac.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14921986/?ref_=sr_i_15

I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/?ref_=sr_i_17

The American Society of Magical Negroes,2.8,"['Justice Smith', 'Zachary Barton', 'Anthony Coons', 'Robbie Troy', 'Gillian Vigman']",Kobi Libii,2024.0,fantasy,"The American Society of Magical Negroes T(ASOMN) is a film that fails to deliver on multiple fronts.One of the primary issues with TASOMN is its lackluster storyline. The plot is riddled with clich√©s and predictable twists, making it difficult for viewers to stay engaged. The film attempts to tackle 'sensitive' themes but it does so in a superficial and often clumsy manner. The lack of depth in exploring these themes leaves much to be desired and results in a film that feels more like a missed opportunity than a meaningful commentary.The performances in the film are another area where it falls short. While the cast may have had potential and if they did their talents are not utilized effectively. The characters are one-dimensional and lack the complexity needed to make them relatable or memorable. This is particularly disappointing given the film's attempt to address significant social issues. The lackluster performances fail to evoke any response making it challenging to connect with the characters or their struggles.Furthermore, the film's pacing is inconsistent, with some scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others feel rushed. This uneven pacing disrupts the flow of the narrative and further detracts from the viewing experience. The dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, which, combined with the subpar performances, makes the interactions between characters unconvincing.In terms of technical aspects, TASOMN does not fare much better. The cinematography is uninspired. The film's score is forgettable, failing to enhance the mood or add any emotional depth to the scenes.TASOMN is a film that fails to deliver anything of value.

Shingeki no Kyojin,9.1,"['Jessie James Grelle', 'Bryce Papenbrook', 'Trina Nishimura', 'Y√ªki Kaji', 'Yui Ishikawa']",All cast & crew,2013.0,fantasy,"I'm a more frequent American TV shows watcher than Anime watcher. I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and clich√© is the same as saying GoT is predictable too üòä.The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=sr_i_24
Avatar: The Last Airbender,9.3,"['Dee Bradley Baker', 'Zach Tyler Eisen', 'Mae Whitman', 'Jack De Sena', 'Dante Basco']",Creators,2005.0,fantasy,"It seems rare for Nickelodeon to turn out a good new show these days, and even more rare for me to like an anime style cartoon, which is why I'm baffled as to why I love this show so much. Having not missed an episode yet, and having a reminder for new episodes on my desktop, I've seen that it just keeps getting better and better as it goes. Some of the story lines are predictable, but that doesn't turn me off of Avatar as it might some other things, which just adds more to my confusion as to why I love this show so much. Many kudos to Nickelodeon, this is easily greatest show since Rocko's Modern Life (IMO) and after Spongebob Squarepants, that is most definitely saying something!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=sr_i_25

Especially a lot about Nica and Rigel's relationship wasn't really portrayed very well on screen and lacked the depth and detail present in the book, which is probably why most people rated this fairly low. I would, too, if I hadn't read the book before. Up until the middle of the movie it was pretty decent and followed the book accurately, but the rest felt incredibly rushed. I really urge people to read the book though, as it's way better than this adaption.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29114029/?ref_=sr_i_26

Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series. The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388629/?ref_=sr_i_27

They said that the movie's timeline doesn't make sense, that the scenes with the parents were ""supposed to be"" in the early 2000s, but they looked like the 80s.That would be because they were: ""Always on My Mind"" by the Pet Shop Boys came out in the fall of 1987, and we hear a DJ say that it's #4 on the charts in the Christmas scene. Also, when he's writing his script about his parents, the type says, ""INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE, 1987""Andrew Scott is 47. If we suppose that Adam is the same age, then Adam was born in about 1975. 1975 + 12 (his age when his parents died) = 1987.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21192142/?ref_=sr_i_28

Irish Wish,5.2,"['Lindsay Lohan', 'Ed Speleers', 'Alexander Vlahos', 'Ayesha Curry', 'Elizabeth Tan']",Janeen Damian,2024.0,fantasy,"I am not going to be over-critical with my review. This movie isn't meant to be anything more than what it is, just a romantic comedy with beautiful scenery. If you are expecting more than that, I suggest you don't bother. The storyline is quaint and predictable. But it was an okay way to spend an hour and a half, even if you were just envious of the backdrop during that time. It is good to see Lindsay Lohan in this rom/com. She is good in the role of her character who can't quite speak up for herself and quite frankly is a bit of a doormat when it comes to her crush Paul Kennedy. But as they say, the grass isn't greener on the other side, it just appears that way. And through a wish to Saint Bridget chaos ensues.If you just want to put something on and tune out for a while, then give it a go.

I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what's going to happen, then before I know it the programme is finished and I have to wait to find out what happens next. Utterly gripping! This show is amazing and I hope they continue to make it because often fantastic US shows get cancelled because the ratings start to dip slightly or the executives think the shows are too weird.

The Witcher,8.0,"['Freya Allan', 'Henry Cavill', 'Anya Chalotra', 'Eamon Farren', 'Mim√Æ M Khayisa']",Creator,2019.0,fantasy,"Netflix has once again released a series that has incredible potential, but has been undermined by horrible writing and extremely weak casting choices. Henry Cavill was an inspired choice as Geralt of Rivia, and obviously brings a lot of knowledge and fondness to the role. He gives the series a luster that is unfortunately quickly dimmed by the horribly dimwitted writing. Eels??? What is with the Eels??? Note: that didn't need a spoiler alert. If you've seen the series, you'll know what I am talking about, and if you haven't, you will know when you witness that silly travesty.The sets are lush and well done, the costumes are good, and the music fits well with the setting. The exception to the music is when Dandelion goes from Medival to something akin to ""Pop Harp"". Grating doesn't even begin to describe it. I did like the action scenes, as Henry Cavill is very believable as a athletic monster slayer.So overall, I give a 9 to Cavill and the great atmosphere of the series. The supporting cast are sporadic and generally weak, and rate no more than a 5 or 6. The writing, and in particular the scenes added to the script that were never in the original books, was extremely weak, and garnered no more than a 2 or at the most 3. I gave the show a 6. Mildly entertaining, but falls far short of the original books and the three Witcher games.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/?ref_=sr_i_35

Like really badly.Other than the world design and effects, there really isn't much else to salvage from it.In true Snyder style we've got lens flare and slow motion, but this time he's dialled it up over the top.Some of the action scenes are absolutely ruined from way too much diving in and out of slow motion.The biggest disappointment is the writing.The first 70% of the film is absolutely a waste of time and not needed.You don't find out most of the characters actual relevance until the back end of the film.Everything before that is a mixture of utterly pointless painfully boring scenes done for the sole purpose of filler.Looks great, but that's all.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14998742/?ref_=sr_i_36

To fulfill the character count.... Heddy and Sass are my favorite American character ghosts. Mary, Kitty and Thomas are favorites in the UK show.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,5.6,"['Jason Momoa', 'Patrick Wilson', 'Yahya Abdul-Mateen II', 'Amber Heard', 'Nicole Kidman']",James Wan,2023.0,fantasy,"Going to this film, I expected little to nothing after hearing how awful people thought it was. To my surprise, it wasn't that bad and I actually enjoyed this film. It wasn't without its problems, but I was pretty satisfied with it being what it was.The cons of this film are mainly dialogue and CGI. There are all of these cheesy lines that you would expect to hear and one line jokes at the end of a scene, almost like you are watching a sitcom series. Jason Mamoa as an actor has charisma and knows how to steal the show. But unlike the first Aquaman, here it feels as if he's just playing himself. There is no real depth to Arthur's (Jason Mamoa) arc, by the end he is still this punk cool guy which is fine but really nothing else.Here you have two villains. Black manta who was alright but ultimately fell short and then this monstrosity named Kordax who honestly looks like a power ranger villain, it's rough. The problem here for me is that this could've been an exciting hunt movie where Black Manta is just wreaking havoc on Arthurs life, without all of the supposed fleshing out of this universe.CGI here was just bad. Didn't look real or feel real. What's funny is that if you go back ten years or so, where the technology wasn't near what it is today, you have all these high- budget blockbuster films that are just beautiful. What happened?Now for what I did like. The biggest pro in my opinion is the Arthur and Orm dynamic. They have this wonderful chemistry and it turned out to have a heartwarming send off to Orm's character. I think Patrick Wilson is great as Orm. His character had a redemption arc which I just loved.The action here was also fun. There is a scene between Arthur and Black Manta where they are fighting with their tridents which was intense. Another sequence I had a really great time with was when Arthur breaks Orm out of prison. Quite a few jokes landed for me too.This film is a mess and yet has its moments. I finished the film thinking to myself ""Wow, don't judge a book by its cover"". Give this a shot, you might also enjoy this enough. It sums up to a brotherly fun adventure movie, without taking it too seriously.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9663764/?ref_=sr_i_39

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,7.6,"['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Emma Watson', 'Richard Harris', 'Maggie Smith']",Chris Columbus,2001.0,fantasy,"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/?ref_=sr_i_42

I found it a refreshing spin on the original 90's version, which was cute but I was never that in to it. But, honestly you really can't call this a remake. My biggest issues are with Sabrina's annoying damn friends. This ridiculous obsession with Harvey and the hypocrisy that is her ""i don't want to join the club but i want the benefits"" mindset. Like it exhausting watching her put her friends and family in danger constantly and then turn around and say she's doing it all so that she can maintain her freedom.

Trolls Band Together,6.0,"['Anna Kendrick', 'Justin Timberlake', 'Kenan Thompson', 'Walt Dohrn', 'Anderson .Paak']",Walt Dohrn,2023.0,fantasy,"A cinema full of children (and parents who had to accompany their children *g*). Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film. There will probably be few judgments in between. But children will be thrilled.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14362112/?ref_=sr_i_46
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,7.8,"['Gene Wilder', 'Jack Albertson', 'Peter Ostrum', 'Roy Kinnear', 'Julie Dawn Cole']",Mel Stuart,1971.0,fantasy,"The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures.

Lucifer,8.1,"['Tom Ellis', 'Lauren German', 'Kevin Alejandro', 'D.B. Woodside', 'Lesley-Ann Brandt']",Creator,2016.0,fantasy,"Lucifer really surprised me by how much I enjoyed it. First of all, I can't say enough about Tom Ellis. He is perfect for this role. I know a lot of people have already said this but he's a really underrated actor. I can't wait to see what he does next. Lucifer is based off the Neil Gaiman comics. It's part fantasy, part comedy, part mystery, among other things. Some of the seasons seem a bit stretched out with some filler episodes but overall every season is terrific. Lucifer was canceled by Fox after three seasons but the fans were so upset and loud about it that Netflix picked it up and it continued for another three seasons, ending after Season 6. I already miss this show now that it's gone. We'll always have the reruns though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/?ref_=sr_i_49

This is supposed to be a fun fantasy series and to me, it achieved that goal. Pure delight.

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that .

Some aspects of this series are accurate to a degree. Most, not so much. As drama, it's fine. But, why take a remarkable true story and burden it with unbelievable situations? History is inherently fascinating when played straight. This is a mishmash. The acting is adequate, the production values satisfactory, but so much is lost with the storytelling.

The Zone of Interest,7.5,"['Christian Friedel', 'Sandra H√ºller', 'Johann Karthaus', 'Luis Noah Witte', 'Nele Ahrensmeier']",Jonathan Glazer,2023.0,history,"There exists a series of clips of Adolf Hitler that, to a lot of people, is actually a lot harder to stomach than his enraged speeches and hateful bellows followed by thundering cheers. They show him during his downtime, playing with his kids and charming Eva Braun, acting not altogether unpleasant. As nauseating as the more well-known footage of him may be, there is something singularly disturbing -- even horrifying -- about the reminder that, yes, this monster was in fact human.The Zone of Interest, in a way, does for Holocaust films what that haunting clip does for WW2 footage. There are untold movies about this point in history that are horrific to watch; yet, they are movies we can accept. There is a disconnect between us and the ferocious, clearly evil Nazis. This movie, though it depicts next to no actual barbarity, may go down as the most harrowing of them all.Like Klondike, it is a war film whose horror comes not from images of violence, but from the casual way that violence is treated by those at the center of war, only this time, it is not from the vantage point of traumatized innocents. As Jeff Zhang's review points out, this is not the sort of Holocaust film that puts the atrocities of Nazi Germany in the preferred blunt terms: ""Its acts of evil -- oozing on the periphery of domestic rigamarole -- are designed to needle and splinter in the brain rather than suck the air out of the room: ashes of the dead in the river as nuisance, installing Auschwitz ovens like they're dishwashers, gunshots and wails of anguish heard but not seen...""More precisely, the movie follows a German man as he simply, well, spends time with his loving family at their lovely home -- which, as it happens, is situated right by the walls of one of the deadliest concentration camps of The Third Reich, whose death and suffering are acknowledged only when they ""intrude"" on the family's peace. The man is Rudolf H√∂ss, who was the Auschwitz commandant 1940-1943. One of the biggest stirs in the family is when he learns he may be promoted, possibly forcing them to move.In a genre that often forces us to look into Hell, this movie forces us to remain blind. To be clear, that's not to say that the truth is hidden; we're painfully aware of what's being kept from us as we're put in the comfort in which people sat, and continue to sit, while watching genocide from afar. And it isn't just the audience that Glazer puts into this position:The actors, particularly the leads Christian Fiedel and Sandra H√ºller, are eerily convincing and they may have ended up eerily CONVINCED during filming. All but forced to immerse themselves in the lives of the H√∂sses, they sometimes weren't informed where exactly the cameras were located -- only that certain rooms in the H√∂ss household contained cameras (sometimes they didn't even get to hear which ones). The actors go about the family's routines, presented to us in real time. This Cach√©-esque cinematography only strengthens the feeling that we're sitting somewhere in the house, watching; hearing what they hear; forced to ignore what they ignore.Basically, this is not akin to such Holocaust dramas as Schindler's List, Son of Saul, or Come and See; however, it isn't quite a film like Shoah either -- a movie that, whereas some would insist that we have a duty to ""depict"" Nazi violence so that it's clear to future generations this mustn't happen again, suggests that it cannot be done, and so relies solely on the words of survivors, letting our minds fill in the rest. In the words of David Ehlrich, The Zone of Interest ""splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre""; other reviews view it as a reaction to Godard and Haneke's statements re: Schindler's List, accusing Spielberg of trying to make suffering entertaining.This is indeed a film that sticks in your brain. It leaves us horrified, not that people like the H√∂sses existed and still exist amongst us, but that the movie may simply be a mirror -- here we sit, in a warm building in comfortable chairs as lives are ended by the day in Palestine, Congo, Sudan, and several others that most of you probably haven't even heard of yet. There is a world of difference between being uninformed and being an SS officer of course, but complicity takes many forms and both types of person are victims of the same propaganda. Now, will you look past the wall?By design, the movie doesn't have the sort of nightmarish visuals we may expect from Glazer; yet, there are shots of dark hallways and other pitch-black images where the darkness seems as alive and all-consuming as the liquid void from Under the Skin. (The music, by Mica Levi, during these moments was succinctly described by a YouTube commenter as ""the Universe mournfully sighing"".) While I recommend seeing the film in theaters -- in a setting where you can truly appreciate the sound design and purposeful imagery -- these particular sequences may work even better at home.On certain screens, when you stare into pitch blackness, you eventually discover your own face in it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7160372/?ref_=sr_i_9

The quality of the scripts, acting, and sets are all on a par with the production values of a well-regarded Hollywood 'short season' series. And the depiction of the historical culture and the conjectural backstories for key figures around Jesus are BETTER than anything I have seen elsewhere.

I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative.

Shogun,8.1,"['Richard Chamberlain', 'Toshir√¥ Mifune', 'Y√¥ko Shimada', 'Furank√Æ Sakai', 'Alan Badel']",All cast & crew,1980.0,history,"In 1976, James Clavell wrote an epic masterpiece: the story of Blackthorne, an English sailor lost in Feudal Japan. He gradually finds his place, oft the central pawn of political intrigues between various foreign powers and the local warlords. In 1980, this miniseries was unleashed on the world and created a whole new audience for the mammoth bestseller. No small feat considering the length and complexity of Clavell's 1200+ page door-stopper. Clocking in at almost 10 hours, this mega-budgeted series delivers the goods. People who have seen ""The Last Samurai"" might see a few plot similarities (even in certain smaller details: Tom Cruise sports exactly the same haircut as Richard Chamberlain). With all respect for the 2003 film, Shogun is far out of it's reach.Richard Chamberlain embodies Blackthorne to perfection, successfully gaining our empathy through an ambiguous yet very human performance. Supporting him are Japanese icon Toshiro Mifune as the shrewd warlord and aspiring shogun Torunaga, who befriends/manipulates Blackthorne, and Yoko Shimada as Blackthorne's translator, confident and friend. Every actor gives life to Clavell's carefully drawn and layered characters (most of all a very bombastic John Rhys-Davies). For a television miniseries, the technical specs are quite surprisingly good. Indeed the budget must have been quite important (and set a record at the time) but never is the story or it's rhythm scarified to show-off. The direction and photography are quite tasteful, often reminiscent of early Kurosawa, only in color. Maurice Jarre's score might not reach the lofty heights of his work for David Lean but it serves it's purpose.Many will tell you that the book is better. It is certainly more intimate and detailed, but a more faithful and excellent adaptation of such a rich book you are not likely to see anytime soon. For anyone with a taste for epics, Japan or just plain good entertainment, this is essential viewing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/?ref_=sr_i_16

Wicked Little Letters,7.0,"['Jessie Buckley', 'Olivia Colman', 'Timothy Spall', 'Gemma Jones', 'Malachi Kirby']",Thea Sharrock,2023.0,history,"It is the 1920's and in the picturesque seaside village of Littlehampton, trouble is brewing. Spinster Edith Swan begins receiving anonymous, obscene letters, which her father thinks are coming from their young Irish neighbour, Rose Gooding. Gooding denies sending the malicious mail, though few in the village believe her. It is up to female police officer Gladys Moss, alongside a couple of sympathetic ladies, to prove Gooding's innocence and catch the real culprit before she is convicted.Based on a true story, Thea Sharrock's 'Wicked Little Letters' is a lightweight comic-drama, neither very funny nor dramatic. Screenwriter Jonny Sweet succumbs to the familiar, false thought that coarse language equates to comedic gold. In addition, the narrative is neither particularly mysterious or suspenseful. Moreover, his characterisation is based almost entirely on cliched stereotypes: prim, proper English conservatives, rowdy Irish women and bumbling policemen included. Furthermore, the world of the film is unbelievable, containing not a trace of racism whatsoever, while the sexism exhibited throughout is utilised mainly as a joke.In many ways, it is an old-fashioned film, trying to say something clever about misogyny, while also playing into misogynistic attitudes. The women- bar officer Moss- are stereotypes dialled up to the max, with little to no depth or nuance, Gooding in particular. Your typical boisterous, hard-drinking, loud Irish lass; the archaic cliches that inform her character are almost insulting. Although there are some funny moments and lines of dialogue, the film is not as entertaining as perhaps it could have been.Additionally, it is laden with uninspired visuals. Cinematographer Ben Davis shoots proceedings conventionally, without flair or ingenuity. Although the production values are commendable, and Charlotte Walter's costume design appears period accurate, it is a flat looking picture all the same. Furthermore, Isobel Waller-Bridge's generic score lacks suspense or excitement, sounding as dull and as underwhelming as much of Sweet's dialogue.Casting director Jina Jay has assembled a talented cast of performers, most of whom do commendable work. Jessie Buckley is great as Gooding, overcoming the cliched characterisation of the role. Olivia Colman is typically excellent as the uptight Swan, although neither she nor Buckley are given much of a challenge, acting-wise. Anjana Vasan does the strongest work of all as officer Moss, while Timothy Spall and Joanna Scanlan are similarly excellent as Swan's austere father and a pig farmer, respectively.Although it is well acted, Thea Sharrock's 'Wicked Little Letters' is not particularly entertaining, clever or original. With an underwhelming narrative, cliched characters, drab visuals and a generic score, it does not impress much. Although Jessie Buckley and Olivia Colman both give strong performances, they aren't in any way challenged, and have been much better in other projects. Despite the fact that Anjana Vasan and Timothy Spall impress greatly, this film is forgettable and not as wickedly enjoyable as it could have been.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20234774/?ref_=sr_i_18
One Life,7.6,"['Anthony Hopkins', 'Lena Olin', 'Johnny Flynn', 'Helena Bonham Carter', 'Tim Steed']",James Hawes,2023.0,history,"All One Life has to do to honour its true story is tell it with care and competency and that's exactly what it does. This is a deeply affecting story of selfless people who did everything they could to save as many people as possible whilst others just ignored what was going on.Anthony Hopkins is on terrific form here. He embodies the selflessness effortlessly and brings a heartbreaking sense of defeat, focusing on what he could've done rather than what he achieved. He's also one of the rare actors who can make you cry by bringing on the waterworks, when he cries you cry.In the flashbacks Johnny Flynn is an extremely convincing younger version of Hopkins with that same desire to always do more. Helena Bonham Carter gets a loveable role supporting Flynn with a stern determination and refusal to take no for an answer.James Hawes directs with a level of technical competency that's designed to go unnoticed. The production value is reminiscent of a high end BBC production, which is obviously very fitting and the pacing is really strong.

The Greatest Story Ever Told,6.6,"['Max von Sydow', 'Dorothy McGuire', 'Charlton Heston', 'Michael Anderson Jr.', 'Carroll Baker']",George Stevens,1965.0,history,"I first saw this film when it was first released -- in the cinema and on a large screen with brilliant color and rich deep stereo sound. It was breathtaking! George Stevens Jr. did an absolutely magnificent job in crafting this outstandingly beautiful, sensitive, and powerful motion picture. This was not just a deeply moving re-telling of the story of Jesus (albeit with a touch of a pro-legend approach). More than that, in its visual sweep, insightful acting of the lead characters (especially of Max Von Sydow as Jesus), and resplendent musical track, this film conveyed a true sense of majesty -- a marked rarity in most film these days.I must concur with one of the other online reviewers here, on a related point: I too believe that it was a shame, and an error on the part of Stevens, that various key characters were portrayed all-too-noticeably by some major film/entertainment stars who just seemed to be bizarrely out-of-place in their roles -- such as John Wayne as the Roman Centurion who, never before seen in the film until this moment, looks up at Jesus on the Cross and says ""Truly, this man was the son of God!"" (I almost expected Wayne to tag his line with the word ""Pilgrim""); or such as singer Pat Boone, who jarringly appears in the role of a cloaked man who, sitting in Jesus' vacated tomb, says to a searching Roman, ""Why seek Ye the living among the dead?"" (Here too, I think that I was not the only one who half-expected Boone to leap to his feet and break out into singing one of his big hits such as ""Bernardine"" or ""Love Letters In The Sand"").But those discontinuities aside, I would still say that ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" is an outstanding film that merits very high marks.

My wife and I are best friends and there is nothing more we enjoy than finding a good British series to immerse ourselves together. We have done this for many years, initially finding them in our travels to Britain, and find that British shows seem to ""out weigh"" our American television on many levels.The subject matter is really unique and absorbing and the acting superb! The complexity of the characters and their interaction, the humor, the secrets, the context, and the weight and undercurrents of its gracious messages have impacted us and continue to do so.So many times it seems that these British series don't last and are canceled just as we are dedicated to them. It is rewarding to see ""Call the Midwife"" continuing on and we hope it does so for many years to come. We will continue to be fans as long as ""Call the Midwife"" lives!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1983079/?ref_=sr_i_24
Ferrari,6.5,"['Adam Driver', 'Shailene Woodley', 'Giuseppe Festinese', 'Alessandro Cremona', 'Derek Hill']",Michael Mann,2023.0,history,"Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3758542/?ref_=sr_i_25
Chernobyl,9.3,"['Jessie Buckley', 'Jared Harris', 'Stellan Skarsg√•rd', 'Adam Nagaitis', 'Emily Watson']",Creator,2019.0,history,"As my mother tells it, the weather was quite nice, the sky was clear without any sign of clouds in the spring of 1986. It was like any other day behind the iron curtain. Not a lot to do but not a lot to worry about either, a long day of boring work after dropping the kid off at the kindergarten, just to pick him up again at the afternoon, just like yesterday or any other day since the beginning of time. This is why she did not understand why the old lady (who she very much liked because she seemed to love children and had that neverstopping smile) told everyone at the nursery school not to let the children out to play, don't feed them the veggies and don't let them drink the milk we had for every lunch before that day. We lived in a hungarian town close to the croatian border and the life in that town was pretty simple apart from that day. We lived 900 kms from Chernobyl and we did not even know that place exists until 3 days later.Apparently a man who did not introduce himself called most of the schools and nurseries in the country and told them the same message. A lot of teachers did not take it seriously as he did not mention any details, just the warning: do not let the children out, do not feed them any vegetables which grows overground (potatoes are fine), do not let them drink anything apart from bottled liquids.Noone knew what it was about. Noone knew what danger we are in. I assume this is why it was such a shock. The life was simple and we were not supposed to know stuff. We were not supposed to be afraid, maybe only because the capitalist pigs over the iron curtain. But something changed that day. A faceless, nameless man risked his life and called everyone he could to warn them about Chernobyl. News like this is not easy to contain, soon everyone was talking about what could happen and why. Is it a nuclear attack? Is it the CIA? Are they looking at us from satelites? Are they bombing us?It was the first crack on the Iron Curtain. Not Reagan's stupid monologue, not the thousands of fleeing east-germans, not the soviets economy's ridiculous debts. Entire nations realized their lives mean nothing, millions felt betrayed. A man with no name defeated the Soviet regime with a few telephone calls.We still don't know who that man was. After 30 years and a few inquiries we have no clue who risked his life to prevent thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses. Some historians are adamant the person was executed and vanished without a trace, some say noone found him at all. All I know I have to be grateful for him. We all have to be. He saved a nation. Sure, we could survive the radioactive cloud the mild wind blew over our country but when I look at my two children who are the same age I was back then I am pretty sure I am not willing to take any risks. Would you?Dear anonymous man who defied a violent regime to save millions: We will forever be grateful. Dear ukranian workers whose names we will never know: We will forever be grateful. The workers whose names we know: We will forever be grateful.This show tells a story noone should forget and this is the right way to tell it. Bluntly. How the man with no name told us.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/?ref_=sr_i_26
La sociedad de la nieve,7.8,"['Enzo Vogrincic', 'Agust√≠n Pardella', 'Mat√≠as Recalt', 'Esteban Bigliardi', 'Diego Vegezzi']",J.A. Bayona,2023.0,history,"Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity.Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo...This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it.BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. Completely right!With films like THE PLATFORM, BELOW ZERO and most recently NOWHERE, the global streaming service NETFLIX has proven that it has an excellent hand for Spanish-language cinema. THE SOCIETY OF THE SNOW will most certainly continue this success story.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16277242/?ref_=sr_i_27
Jesus of Nazareth,8.5,"['Robert Powell', 'Olivia Hussey', 'Laurence Olivier', 'James Mason', 'Anne Bancroft']",All cast & crew,1977.0,history,"There has been no other biblical film that touched me like this one. Dispite all the little details that have been criticized and pointed out, these should be of no consequence.  The illustration of Jesus' life story in this film was rich.  Not only can you feel the strong presence of Christ through Robert Powell, but you also can get a taste of the times in which he lived.Although the film, like many biblical films, tries to clearly depict the spiritual nature of Christianity, this one goes beyond that.  It gives you a glimpse into the politics, social/religious hierarch, economics, and the mindstate of the Jewish and Roman communities throughout the era.  It's more than just your typical Christ film. It's gives you a broader view and a complete understanding of what it was like to live in the times of Jesus Christ.Besides being a historical landmark and the great religous story that it is, this film also takes you through the ups and downs. The doubts, the hardships, the miracles, and the uprising. A very 3 Dimensional drama.I am a Christian, and while I might not be as devout as some, my faith is strong and this film re-enforced that spirituality.  It was very moving to hear the lessons and wise preachings of Jesus in a similar setting to the one where he once stood.  To see the dramas first hand, from an unbiased point of view.I would advise everyone to see this movie atleast once. No matter if your a Christian or not.  The morals and lessons taught by Jesus Christ can be appreciated by anyone.  Not just as the Son Of God, but as a Man who strongly believed in Love and goodwill towards his fellow Man. Not only as a religious icon, but as a mentor, moral activist, and humanitarian to his people. His words are universal.  What he stood for is greater than any man that ever walked the face of this Earth.  This film gives you that insight. It goes farther than showing you a religious belief...it gives you the reason why it's worth believing in.I give this film 9/10.  Powerful, Enlightening, and Emotionally driven. The Greatest Story Ever Told dramatized for all to enjoy time and time again.If you liked this film, I also recommend ""The Robe (1953)"" and ""The Ten Commandments (1956)""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075520/?ref_=sr_i_28
Kingdom of Heaven,7.3,"['Orlando Bloom', 'Eva Green', 'Liam Neeson', 'Martin Hancock', 'Michael Sheen']",Ridley Scott,2005.0,history,"""Why was the Crusader braver then the pirate? Because he fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took Spain from us, though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic Church, we swept them back to Africa.""Clearly, director Ridley Scott does not agree with the above somewhat simplified philosophy expressed by Shaw through his character Don Juan. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", wars and battles are fuelled by an assortment of motivations including land, money, political consideration, natural desire for violence, lust for fame, love of the common people, among others. Even more importantly, this ""idea"" thing does not prevent leaders from practicing tolerance, reaching compromises and even recognizing equality with alien faiths, as the movie tries to show us. Recognizing that this movie is a mix of historical fact and dramatized fiction, let me focus on one rather unusual aspect of the hero Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith inheriting knighthood and an estate from a father appearing out of the blues. As Balian takes over the barren desert estate after the untimely death of the recently-discovered father, he does something that the father apparently has failed to do in all these years ¬ñ dig into the earth to find a reliable source of water and proceed to make the estate productive. Later, the resilient defence of Jerusalem owes just as much to Balian's knowledge of practical laws of mechanics as to his military skills. In the end, he turns away from the inherited knighthood and goes back to be a blacksmith, taking with him a queen. Triumph of the working class, as my summary line suggests.Depiction of the arch adversary Saladin follows very much the line taken in the novels of Sir Walter Scott (another Scott here!), particularly ""The Talisman"", as someone mysterious (to the extent of being almost omnipresent - in the novel) but wise and benevolent, a breed of political leader that is sadly in short supply today. The hero Balian, as mentioned, has little interest in divinity and every interest in the welfare of the people. These two leaders, put in today's context, could qualify ""Kingdom of Heaven"" for a fairy tale.It's difficult to refrain from comparing the attack of Jerusalem with the attack of Minas Tirith, and this very comparison can be construed as an unreserved compliment on Kingdom of Heaven. Another comparison that can be made is the depiction of a mighty army, done so unimaginatively in two similar movies last year. In Kingdom of Heaven, we see first a solitary figure on horseback at a distant mountain gap. ""Saladin's army of 200 thousand is here"" says Balian. ""There's only one person"", comes the reply from a follower. ""No, they're all here"" Balian quietly responses, at which point the angle of the camera starts to rise, first revealing the patch behind the mountain gap, filled with soldiers. Then, as the horizon of our vision continues to extend, layers of mountains and vales continue to appear, together with Saladin's mighty army deployed in an apparently haphazard, but ultimately strategic fashion. This must be seen to appreciate. Of the cast, I must first mention Edward Norton. As the leper king of Jerusalem, he appears all the time behind a mask which covers his entire face, showing only his eyes with disfigured corners. But it's the voice that is so mesmerizing. Ever since Fight Club, Norton's voice has such a timbre that soft as he sounds, there are lurking behind tantalizing hints of subtlety, intrigue, compassion, power, and twenty other different and conflicting emotions all at once.Bloom grows into his role, starting rather expressionless (which may not be totally unreasonable considering that the character has just lost a wife and a child) but gradually gaining in confidence. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, playing father and mentor respectively, do not exactly have the most challenging parts in their careers. Eva Green retains the girlish defiance in The Dreamer, but adds to it the maturity and allure required for the role of Sibylla (as portrayed by the script, but not necessarily as recorded in history). And there is good old Brendan Gleeson, in the customary role of big bully fighter which he has perfected in Gangs of New York and Troy. Kingdom of Heaven is one cut above Troy and Alexander last year.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320661/?ref_=sr_i_29

Fantastic animation style, music (with a Japanese version of For Whom The Bell Tolls being something I that I never knew I ever needed!), and the dialogue with a stellar voice cast that all contribute to a great show that I was fully invested in from start to finish. The show does however at times over-rely on it's use of sex scenes, and I'm not prudish, but it does feel a little awkward at times.

The Favourite,7.5,"['Olivia Colman', 'Emma Stone', 'Rachel Weisz', 'Nicholas Hoult', 'Emma Delves']",Yorgos Lanthimos,2018.0,history,"If The Favourite had music by Michael Nyman. I would had said that it was directed by Peter Greenaway. I do think Greenaway was a big influence with the style of the film, as well as the Oscar winning Tom Jones that lent it some naughtiness.Director Yorgos Lanthimos adds a rich period setting and visual flourishes. He keeps his camera moving and has lot of fisheye views.Underneath it all is a power play between three women in 18th Century England. Two of them vie to be Queen Anne's favourite even if this means massaging more than her legs.Abigail (Emma Stone) has fallen on hard times. She arrives at Court hoping for employment from her cousin, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz.) She is the Queen's trusted adviser, lady in waiting, confidante and even lover.Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is ill. She has gout, she is mentally unstable. She lost 17 children and she has 17 rabbits that she plays with. Governing the country is something she finds difficult especially as Britain is at war with France.Abigail wants to ingratiate herself with Queen Anne and climb the greasy pole to secure her position. Over time Abigail and Lady Sarah fight, dirtily to be the Queen's favourite.The Favourite is a crude, grimy, seedy, bawdy drama in tone and language. Lanthimos is certainly not interested in showing a wholesome chocolate box portrait of 18th century life.This is a sumptuous looking costume drama about fragile cruel people and egos. People who are desperate to get to the top and remain there.The film unravels in the second half and gets bogged down. At the end Abigail may not be quiet in control as she thinks, I did think the ending was weak and disappointing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/?ref_=sr_i_32
Babylon,7.1,"['Brad Pitt', 'Margot Robbie', 'Jean Smart', 'Olivia Wilde', 'J.C. Currais']",Damien Chazelle,2022.0,history,"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10640346/?ref_=sr_i_33
When Calls the Heart,7.9,"['Erin Krakow', 'Martin Cummins', 'Pascale Hutton', 'Jack Wagner', 'Kavan Smith']",Creators,2014.0,history,"The Hallmark team, with Michael Landon,Jr and Janette Oke have a winner here.A seemingly period piece with contemporary issues , from overbearing parent' s expectations, and complaints about homework and disinterested students and let us not forget the mayor's wife dropping the founder's day play on the teacher; to the cooperative set up of the classroom with its many distractions and interruptions which really to do occur in today's public classroom. Being a public school teacher I could relate and thought the teacher anxiety over the play was portrayed nicely. Loved the scene when Elizabeth trips and Jack catches her.Episode 7, dealing dyslexia. and the conflict with the parents was again portrayed well. Parents and teachers both meaning well, yet not sure what is really best for the child.Episode 8, simply the best most moving, of the season a ""wounded warrior"" (recovering coal miner) from a life changing experience(lost of a leg)- how the individual,the family, and community responded to a person who is different in body and spirit now. Beautiful scene between Jack and Adam around the campfire about a child's perspective when a parent(father)- is injured- being male made it even more meaningful for- since fathers are often children's first heroes.Episode 10 Had the more of western feel with the bank robbers and Jack in the saddle and alone so much and the camera picking up the landscape and scenery, was beautiful. The camera shots the morning after, when the characters were returning to town just stunning.Please do not stop with just one season.

Bodies stands out to me if for no other reason than it has an actual ending.

From it I learnt for ever that Tiberio came after Augustus, followed by Caligula and Claudio. Good for me in history. However, the film is historically wrong. Jesus developed himself, as he was, during the period of Claudio emperor and not during the Caligula's one. If you have any doubt, I recommend you to read ""I Claudius"" and ""Claudius Emperor"" of the writer Robert Greaves. Every year during Easter or Christmas you have the opportunity to see this film in Italy. After seen it so many times (it is always good to see the example of Jesus) one may come to the conclusion that the director, Henry Koster wanted to show how even those who killed Jesus became forgiven and wanted to do good things in favor of the new religion and how the behavior of Pietro and Jesus, already died, influenced the way of thinking of many people even in Imperialistic Rome.

The deserts are real, although the back story is that this is a theatre company, putting on a production in real locations.The cast are largely session singers and unknowns - Ted Neeley, delicate and high-voiced as Jesus (particularly superb in `Gethsemane'); Carl Anderson, black and doe-eyed as Judas with hot soul vocals, Barry Dennen as Pilate, and Yvonne Elliman as Magdelene with her big number `I Don't Know How To Love Him'.One loss for those who know the stage version is being removed from the crucifixion preamble, when the ghost of Judas sings `Superstar' - this was all video camera projection in the theatre, while in the movie we are detached observers.  But at other times we get uncomfortably close.  And the songs survive the transportation to a more realistic setting (except the added `Could We Start Again, Please?' which sounds rather too much like the Coca-Cola theme for comfort).Best scenes?

We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant and booked reserved seats in the lifeboats.Michael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There's an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who's read Lewis's memoir of those days, Liar's Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That's why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren't any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.I know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about ""FICO scores."" It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/?ref_=sr_i_41
The Tudors,8.1,"['Jonathan Rhys Meyers', 'Henry Cavill', 'Anthony Brophy', 'James Frain', 'Sarah Bolger']",Creator,2007.0,history,"The Tudors is a fantastic show which showcases the life and times of King Henry the VIII. As the opening of the show tells the viewer, ""You think you know a story but you only know how it ends. To get to the heart of a story you have to go back to the beginning."" I'm sure a lot of people watching the show are watching it for entertainment and not because of its historical accuracy. I personally love Tudor England and know a lot about it. The show takes many liberties, but that's why it's entertainment and not a biographic film on the King. It's fascinating to see what is kept of what many believe to be true and what is changed. Things such as basing Henry's sister Margaret after both his sister Mary and his older sister Margaret is very interesting turn. The first four episodes have been phenomenal works of cinematic art which I hope will continue on for seasons to come.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758790/?ref_=sr_i_42
Tombstone,7.8,"['Kurt Russell', 'Val Kilmer', 'Sam Elliott', 'Bill Paxton', 'Powers Boothe']",George P. Cosmatos,1993.0,history,"The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an uncharismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.It opens with Earp ending his stint as a Kansas law officer and heading for Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan and their families in toe. Upon arrival they meet up with their good friend and Ally Doc Holliday and before long they've acquired a share in a thriving little saloon and card game. A group of ruthless bandits ironically titled 'The Cowboys', also inhabit the town and they take an immediate disliking to the retired lawman's reputation and moral attitudes. So far, Wyatt had done well to keep himself clear of any kind of feuding or trouble, but one fateful night a barbarous act forces him to arrest Curly Bill Brocious the leader of the desperadoes. This eventually results with the historic showdown at the OK Corral and a quest to rid the land from the curse of these malevolent outlaws.On his audio commentary for the Tom Cruise drama Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe describes Kurt Russell as 'Hollywood's best kept secret'. Showing flashes of Clint Eastwood, but without ever looking like he's trying to imitate him, he provides a competent lead and proves that there's certainly a lot of truth to that statement. From his humorous will they won't they yearnings for Jose, to his anguished rage as he screams, `.Hell's coming with me' into the stormy night sky, Russell's on top form. His excellence can't help but play second fiddle to a scene stealing Val Kilmer, who has some of the best dialogue since Mr Blonde shared breakfast with a group of crimms in black suits. Hitting a career high, it's seems surprising that the Academy didn't acknowledge such a worthy portrayal.  The camaraderie between he and Earp is one of Cinema's most pleasurable buddy pairings and no one can deny the pathos he creates in his tragic exit. His rivalry with an underused but adequate Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo is compelling and their dual makes for an irresistible climax. Dana Delaney also shines as the Marshall's 'other' love interest, but frankly with a cast studded with cameos from so many familiar faces - even Charlton Heston - you could give a gibbon the megaphone and the results would probably still feel fairly acceptable!The set locations are the standard cowboy fare, but director Cosmatos manages to make good use of them. The stormy night scenes when Morgan is attacked are crafted to create an electric atmosphere that is superbly lighted and the same can be said for the suspense made in the neatly staged shoot-outs. Clearly accomplished as an action director, Cosmatos certainly was the right Man for this rootin' tootin' ride through the Wild West. He shows a flare for building tension that runs smoothly throughout the beautifully shot set pieces.The only complaint that can be made about Tombstone is the lack of any real depth found within the story. Where as genre classics like Unforgiven offer an emotionally charged drama that snuggles so neatly with the always-ungratuitous gunplay, Kevin Jarre's story falls into the 'popcorn western' category. Along with its contemporaries Young guns or The Quick and the Dead, the movie aims more for blockbuster appeal than a deep and endearing dramatic approach. Still, fans of a six-shooter will find plenty to be impressed by - in this admirable character-led mix of gunplay, companionship, romance and even just the right amount of pathos. Fans still ask which is the better of the two accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that were strangely released around the same time. Well I guess the answer really depends on your personnel taste in movies. If you like the more dramatic western and have no problem with an epic runtime, then Costner and co's biopic maybe the one for you. However if you're looking for a 'popcorn' take on the lawman's life then you need look no further. Tombstone's your movie! It may not have a deep heart, but it's a hell of a lot of fun! 8/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358/?ref_=sr_i_43
Los colonos,7.0,"['Sam Spruell', 'Mark Stanley', 'Alfredo Castro', 'Benjamin Westfall', 'Camilo Arancibia']",Felipe G√°lvez Haberle,2023.0,history,"First of all, there are some people here who have absolutely no idea about any Chilean history. This particular story is not real, but everything you see in the movie did happen, and more, muuuuch more. I am Chilean, or British and Native descent, and I have read on the topic extensively. What European settlers did in Patagonia will blow anyone's mind and this movie is a bit of refreshing justice on a world who chooses to forget. A must watch if you have the guts to face your ancestors history. Not a film for cowards.I recommend anyone who wants to really know what Europeans did to google a little about it, and you'll find plenty about the Selknam, Alacalufe, Onas, Yaganes and many others who perished to feed and clothe the Europeans of the 19th and 20th century. PS: some wrote that is about the foundation of Chile, which is incorrect. The facts on this movie are hundreds of years after that.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370812/?ref_=sr_i_44
The Pacific,8.3,"['James Badge Dale', 'Joseph Mazzello', 'Jon Seda', 'Ashton Holmes', 'Josh Helman']",All cast & crew,2010.0,history,"Please, for the love of God, please do not overlook this miniseries. I have seen way too many people who don't bother to see The Pacific because it wasn't like Band of Brothers. This was in no way, shape, or form meant to be like BoB. If you have studied WW2 at all, you would know that the war in the Pacific was a totally different war than the European theater. I loved Band of Brothers, it was a great and realistic series of the harsh realities of warfare and the scars it can leave. The Pacific was much harder to watch than BoB ever was. BoB was all about the bonds formed in combat and how this can tear people apart. This grim series displayed how completely unprepared the US military was mentally for how truly horrific this war would be. Not only were you fighting the unpredictable and relentless Japanese soldiers, but you were also fighting the terrain. The dense woods, the heavy rain, the thick mud. Not to mention all the diseases that came with these harsh conditions. Water was a luxury in a lot of situations. The filmmakers brilliantly showed how this affected the fighting men, who became virtually hollow shells, their sanity teetering on the edge of their knives. The Japanese killed everyone without remorse. One particular scene that gave me chills to witness was in the latter half of the series when a group of civilians was slaughtered by a Japanese machine gun nest while running to the American forces. One person, a child, started to crawl slowly to the lines, a couple bullet wounds on his body. One of the combat rookies wanted to run in to help the poor boy, but was kept back so they would not be shoot too. All the Marines could do was watch, as the helpless child was brutally killed after a bullet from that machine gun emplacement hit him in the back of the head and his body went limp instantaneously. This is on par with Saving Private Ryan, another collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as one of the most horrific, gruesome, and realistic war dramas ever put to film. I highly recommend giving it a watch, but be warned: this series is not for the faint of heart.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374463/?ref_=sr_i_45

Good cast, Hugh Laurie as ever excellent but not convinced Mark Ruffalo was right for his part, some slightly odd accents going on there!

Abigail,5.8,"['Dan Stevens', 'Kathryn Newton', 'Giancarlo Esposito', 'Matthew Goode', 'Melissa Barrera']",Matt Bettinelli-Olpin,2024.0,horror,"The premise is simple, yet enticing. A group of criminals kidnap a little girl who's the daughter of a powerful underworld figure. Left with this girl as they prepare to collect the ransom from her father, they eventually find out that this little girl has quite the bite to her, and they must band together if they hope to survive the night together.Team Radio Silence have already established themselves as one of the most promising horror collectives in recent memory. Their work in the V/H/S franchise, Ready Or Not, and the latest two SCREAM movies have proven that they are a capable and reliable directorial team. So with this latest film, the question remained: would they keep their winning streak going with this one?Fortunately, this film is a blast and a half. This team have delivered what I'd argue is their best film since Ready Or Not. The action takes a second as the movie develops its central characters and gives us reasons to know them beyond their Rat Pack-inspired names. When the blood starts flowing, though, this movie takes off and flies with absolute gusto! The comedy lands SO many times here, and the actual action/gore sequences deliver in SPADES!The all-star cast excels with this. Melissa Barrera, reuniting with Team Radio Silence after the SCREAM films, shines as the central protagonist. We feel for her and why she does what she does, especially when we learn of her past. Dan Stevens is a foul-mouthed scene-stealer in this, and Kathryn Newton has a number of her own moments here. Giancarlo Esposito and the late Angus Cloud do just as well in smaller roles. The absolute standout, though, is Alisha Weir as the titular vampire. She knocks it out of the park in every scene she's in, and really makes the whole experience worth it.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Check it out with a group of friends when you can, as this movie is best viewed with a crowd. This review comes from the world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival in New Orleans.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27489557/?ref_=sr_i_2
The First Omen,6.9,"['Nell Tiger Free', 'Ralph Ineson', 'Sonia Braga', 'Tawfeek Barhom', 'Maria Caballero']",Arkasha Stevenson,2024.0,horror,"The First Omen: Though similar in plot to Immaculate at a superficial level, this film sticks to the supernatural in the attempts to create the Antichrist. In the prologue an aged Father Harris (Charles Dance) is tracked down by Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson), Harris relates a garbled tale about a baby created through a woman mating with the Devil. The progeny is destined to be the mother of the Antichrist. Shortly afterwards Father Harris is showered by stained glass and a piece of scaffolding takes a chunk out of his head, obviously just happenstance. Rome, 1971, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) arrives from the US to take her vows at a school/orphanage, herself an orphan, she was raised by the Roman Catholic Church. She is met by Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy) who a decade before had counselled her when she was having troubles. They travel to the Convent to the background of Trade Union and Student protests; the Cardinal reflects on how the RCC is also losing the support of young people. These disturbances continue in the background over the radio until Margaret is caught up in a riot during a pivotal scene,The Convent seems to be a happy place, the children are treated well, they have parties, nuns bounce on trampolines, even the elder sisters smoke and crack jokes. However Margaret finds that one child Carlita (Nicole Sorace) is often kept in a room, tied to a bed even. Carlita acts up, is violent, draws strange pictures, Margaret realises that Carlita is acting like she did years ago, suffering from nightmares and visions so she bonds with her. Similar to Immaculate there is a naughty novitiate, Luz (Maria Caballero) she browbeats Carlita into going dancing and drinking, after all one must live before leaving secular life. Things take an odd turn at the orphanage, Carlita has terrifying visions, a strange young nun, Angelica connects with both Margarey and Carlita resulting in a horrifying incident. Father Brennan reappears and tries to convince Margaret that a conspiracy is at play to create the Antichrist. The plot now takes an interesting turn which it would be a spoiler to reveal.The First Omen is a largely satisfying film in its own right and promises to take the franchise off at an angle to the previous films. There are scenes of graphic horror, not least in the birth scenes where elements of body horror are introduced along with Margaret's visions of the risen dead. Some good jump scares but the pacing of the film takes away from the effect of a couple of these. A tightening up of the convent scenes with additional exposition of Margaret's backstory might have improved the flow of the narrative. Nell Tiger Free's part demands a lot and she is equal to it as her character develops. Maria Caballero is wonderful in her nunsploitation role in the hightclub scenes and in her dress sense, this sequence and her later taking of vows introduces a touch of Dario Argento. Nicole Sorace gives a fine performance as the disturbed and conflicted young girl.. Bill Nighy gives further support as the enigmatic and pragmatic Cardinal. Of course The First Omen introduces a few characters who featured in the 1976 film The Omen and even pays homage to several of its gory death scenes (improving on at least one of those). Directed by Arkasha Stevenson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Tim Smith and Keith Thomas from a story by Ben Jacoby. 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5672290/?ref_=sr_i_3
Late Night with the Devil,7.5,"['David Dastmalchian', 'Laura Gordon', 'Ian Bliss', 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'Ingrid Torelli']",Cameron Cairnes,2023.0,horror,"Late Night with the Devil is a new and unique horror flick. Even having seen 500+ horror films, I can't compare this to anything else. It's not groundbreaking or mind-blowing, but it's different and original.It's also really good, well-made in most aspects. It hooks you early on, even before any of the horror starts. For a while you're just enjoying a fabricated late night TV talk show. And then when the horror kicks in, oh does it kick. There are a few memorable and jaw-dropping scenes.My headline is referring to something that drives me crazy. People, including close friends, complain that Hollywood has run out of ideas and only makes sequels, remakes and superhero movies. I respond by showing them all of the original movies released in a year, and how they did not watch any of them. They only go to the theaters a few times a year, and only for the blockbusters. What they're complaining about is their own fault.If you're a fan of horror and are looking for something far from traditional, Late Night with the Devil is for you. And if you're sick of the perceived lack of original ideas, this is the kind of movie you should be supporting.(1 viewing, 3/31/2024)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14966898/?ref_=sr_i_4
The Walking Dead,8.1,"['Andrew Lincoln', 'Norman Reedus', 'Melissa McBride', 'Lauren Cohan', 'Christian Serratos']",Creator,2010.0,horror,"I've been a fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first episode of the first season. Even though the quality has gone down in recent years I still haven't missed an episode. While the last few seasons weren't quite as good they were still worth watching. It did go out on a high note though, the last season was actually pretty good. It had a few slow filler episodes but overall it was solid. Even though it was definitely time for it to end I'm still going to miss it. When something's been apart of your life for so long it's hard to say goodbye. The good news for fans is that there are a few spinoffs coming in 2023. I'm actually interested in the spinoffs considering they all star my favorite characters from the main show. There's three of them so far...one with Rick & Michonne, one with Negan & Maggie and one with Darryl going over to Europe.

I re-watched them several times because they are pure masterpieces. Then, Season 9 came around, and I was so disappointed and couldn't stop questioning whether it was made by the same people who had created all the previous seasons. In season 10, things got even worse. While the first part of the season seemed promising, its finale turned out to be so underwhelming that I felt really let down. Being so disenchanted by it, I couldn't pass even the first episode of the second installment, which, in general, appeared super unappealing. Moving on to this last season, the first episode of Season 11 is such a bummer that I'm not going to continue watching this show anymore. That's enough! It's official, AHS is dead. I was asking myself the whole time while watching that ridiculous episode what it even had to do with AHS. Where is a horror in this story? Where are all the great characters?

I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still.

As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made.

Interview with the Vampire,7.2,"['Assad Zaman', 'Jacob Anderson', 'Sam Reid', 'Eric Bogosian', 'Bailey Bass']",Creator,2022.0,horror,"To sum up this series, I will have to say it is beautifully done. If you enjoy, as do I, films and productions about Vampiric culture, then you will enjoy this latest take on Anne Rice's captivating book, ""Interview with the Vampire, originally published May 5, 1976. Her book was later made into a very enjoyable film in 1994, staring Tom Cruise (Lestat) Brad Pitt (Louis), with a commendable performance by a very young Kirsten Dunst. The rest of the cast truly shined, which featured Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, and Stephen Rea. The film, for the most part, generally matched the novel.This isn't true for this series. Indeed, it makes specific ""turns"" and takes certain ""liberties"" that are either not found in the source material or greatly exaggerated beyond the author's original theme. And while I initially felt it was not going to work, I changed my opinion by the end of the first episode. It works. Indeed, it works very well.There is no need for me to summarize the plot as other IMDb reviewers have already thoroughly covered it. I will say that the dark, often foreboding atmosphere found in both the book and the 1994 film, are very present in this series. It's not easy to take a ""classic piece of literature"" and mold it into an episodic body. I mean - Does the world really need another Casablanca or Gone With the Wind? In this case, I'd have to answer, ""Of course it does!"" You really can't have too much of a good thing, and when it comes to works like this, I find the different nuances and updates extremely entertaining. Give this a try. It is definitely worth your viewing time.No spoilers here as usual for me but I will reveal that during the time of pre-production for the 1994 film, Anne Rice was not happy with the choice of Tom Cruise. She felt he was far too conventional to play the pivotal vampire role of Lestat. Thankfully her opinion was ignored, because Cruise delivered an exceptional performance which she later enthusiastically acknowledged. On December 11, 2021, Rice passed away at the age of 80. And while she approved this series, it remains unknown if she was pleased with the casting of Sam Reid as the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, and Jacob Anderson as his lover and prot√©g√©, Louis de Pointe du Lac.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14921986/?ref_=sr_i_10
Glass,6.6,"['James McAvoy', 'Bruce Willis', 'Samuel L. Jackson', 'Anya Taylor-Joy', 'Sarah Paulson']",M. Night Shyamalan,2019.0,horror,"This is a thinking person's movie. It's largely dialogue heavy and not afraid to take its time. It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.Director Shyamalan doesn't get much respect from the critics, but screw the critics, he did brilliantly here from writing to directing.And James McAvoy deserves every acting award for 2019. Might as well just give him all of them now, best actor, best actress, best child actor, etc., all of them, because no one's topping this performance.And about the action, I saw director Shyamalan talking in an interview about how he's mainly interested in drama and that action is not his strong point, but he was really downplaying his handling of the action, because the fight scenes here are legitimately awesome. Glass thankfully features none of the shaky rapid-editing style that plagues so many other action movies. It is all well shot, so you'll have no trouble following the action. We even see lots of unusually artistic camera shots during the action, such as showing long close up shots of people's faces while they're in the middle of fighting. My favorite was a long held shot from the point of view of being inside a van while we're seeing a fight happening outside, as the combatants are circling around and slamming into the van. That was just plain cool, the kind of shot that's just mind-boggling to think about how they managed to pull it off.And don't trust the rotten critics. Just don't. They're so worthless, those critics. They're wrong about almost every movie these days.

I agree with all previous comments.A clich√©d production in terms of script, direction and visuals. Unrealistic/unbelievable actions by all the principal cast and by the police! :).

Please, no.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12349832/?ref_=sr_i_14

If you liked Yeon Sang-ho's
Train to Busan (2016),
the live-action sequel Peninsula (2020), and
first South Korean superhero film Psychokinesis (2018)
then you are sure to enjoy his first live action TV series.Parasyte: The Grey has the same creative writing and worthwhile surprises, committed acting, judicious use of music to good effect, and action galore. It's very watchable--and not too many drawn-out episodes.As in Yeon Sang-ho's other films he commits to his trope, injects them with vitality and freshness; then, explores how many balls he can keep juggling in the air while he deepens the thematic issues.I can think of few studios who thrive on tropes and make something better than expected from them (see also Skydance, a US studio: Heart of Stone (2023) on Netflix). Here we have four strong female characters, a small time hood who finds redemption and liberal use of tropes from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (without the Red Scare Communist subtext).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21874396/?ref_=sr_i_15
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2,5.5,"['Scott Chambers', 'Tallulah Evans', 'Ryan Oliva', 'Lewis Santer', 'Eddy MacKenzie']",Rhys Frake-Waterfield,2024.0,horror,"Well, here we are again. We watched this last night in the cinema with about 15 other people. Why do I do this to myself? Because I love horror films. Love them. And I wanted so much to enjoy the first Blood and Honey, and I felt scammed. But with the promise of an increased budget and what appeared to be positive things being said about it, I thought I would give it another go.The budget has been spent on three things. The costumes have been improved upon. And, they have clearly spent a lot on getting Tiktokers to say good things, and the admittedly clever use of marketing.But, make no mistake, it's bad. I will say worse than the first, because here we can't try to partially blame a low budget. It falls firmly at the doorstep of bad filmmaking.The director doesn't seem to know how to make a film scary or interesting or look good or get good performances or frame a good shot or create tension or.... Looking at their IMDB it would appear they have made ALOT of films. How is it that they don't know anything about what makes a film work? The writer shows no skill in creating a cohesive story with some muddled backpedaling to the original idea. It's also strangely boring. We didn't walk out like we did the first, as I had heard there was a rave scene at the end of the film. But it's not worth waiting for. Again, no tension, no scare, just some badly rendered gore, weird camera angles, bad lighting, jarring music and, like the first, kills offscreen.The acting is bad. Here, one of the producers has cast (or rather mis-cast) themselves as Christopher Robin. I think making Christopher Robin a gay character is an interesting and novel idea. But they make absolutely no mention to it whatsoever. They also have a one expression look throughout and the Pooh confrontation is cringe. All the victims can't even scream with any level of believability. The parents for some reason both mumble their way through their lines (as if they received the script two minutes beforehand). And Simon Callow? Please fire your agent, immediately. You used to make good films.Luckily there are lots of other good horror films on the horizon, made by people who know what they are doing. Another positive is met some nice other horror fans (who also hated this film btw).But I am out with these. Officially.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23330554/?ref_=sr_i_16

From the initial scene that shows you the main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong.

It felt much more serious and quite a bit darker at times. The movie was amazing, the effects were great. I never thought I'd see a Godzilla movie where people were crying in the theater. It was quite the experience. Godzilla was truly an unstoppable force in this movie, whenever Godzilla would show up it was hard to feel anything but futility. Even in the rare event that Godzilla was injured he was only slowed down.

DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's 'The Walking Dead'.The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! üòÇIn conclusion, credit to Braun but everyone else onscreen and off it could've done better in my opinion.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26658104/?ref_=sr_i_19

In that respect it is similar to Beetlejuice for me personally. A totally campy film with a lot of things that don't make sense or aren't fully explained; it feels like there are some deleted scenes that should have been left in, but maybe they were concerned about the film running too long and kept it short and simple.Kathryn Newton gives an excellent performance as the main character, and her dad reminds me so much of the dad in Coraline.It's simply entertaining dark humor in a teen angst storyline!

Split,7.3,"['James McAvoy', 'Anya Taylor-Joy', 'Haley Lu Richardson', 'Jessica Sula', 'Betty Buckley']",M.

Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4972582/?ref_=sr_i_21

Avoid trailers, even synopses (maybe even this review). Discovering the premise is as enjoyable as the rest of the movie.But even after being amused by this unique and creative premise, it didn't seem like there was anywhere else for this idea to go. But there's no reason to worry. The directions it takes are just as creative as the premise.Even though it's very different, this gave me Eternal Sunshine vibes, especially with how original it feels. The humor is fairly dry, which I normally don't like. But it made me laugh a decent amount, usually loudly. And there are a few moments that hit hard.Nick Cage. Oh Nick Cage. I watch all his movies. Most are bad, but Dream scenario is part of the resurgence (along with Massive Talent). And even though most people just want to see his hilarious freakouts, here he reminds us that he is one of the most talented actors out there. I haven't forgotten.

The animation in this is also much better and more improved than the pilot and the pilot isn't even canon anymore. Also the music and songs in this show are all awesome too and I can listen to them over and over again on my phone. Yep, this show kicks so much ass and it f...ing rocks!

The movie had some really thrilling sequences and the overall ambience was really well catered to the theme of the movie. All actors gave a tremedous performance, along with the music amplifying the gravity of these odd affairs.Now, I would admit that this movie did have some slight issues like some questionable and possibly, dumb choices that the protagonists made (which I can't disclose here), and some 'moral of the story' like dialogues and a few villainous ones which I don't really mind but here they just felt forced.Apart from all these, it's a real good thriller, and especially Madhavan's performance, steals the show.

X,6.5,"['Mia Goth', 'Jenna Ortega', 'Brittany Snow', 'Kid Cudi', 'Martin Henderson']",Ti West,2022.0,horror,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13560574/?ref_=sr_i_30

I found it a refreshing spin on the original 90's version, which was cute but I was never that in to it. But, honestly you really can't call this a remake. My biggest issues are with Sabrina's annoying damn friends. This ridiculous obsession with Harvey and the hypocrisy that is her ""i don't want to join the club but i want the benefits"" mindset. Like it exhausting watching her put her friends and family in danger constantly and then turn around and say she's doing it all so that she can maintain her freedom.

Like most, Darryl was one of my favorite characters from the original show so I've been looking forward to this. It didn't disappoint. This follows the story of fan favorite Darryl Dixon as he travels across the ocean to France. There he's put in charge of protecting a young boy who's thought to be the savior for humanity. Between this and Dead City, The Walking Dead is back and as good as ever. This reminds me of the early seasons of the original where you couldn't wait until the next episode instead of just watching because you put so much time into it and wanted to see what happens but it almost felt like a chore.

But overall it tried it hardest to be different and avoid the same old thing we've seen time and again. It had a decent plot with a couple of twists, and good acting. But is a mild horror really.

And he does NOT have any crazy-Cage moments. Even so, Arcadian is still a solid horror flick.When it comes to these types of low-budget isolation movies with tiny casts, they frequently don't have enough substance to warrant the runtime. Not enough happens to make it entertaining. But that's not the case with Arcadian. There are lots of intense and suspenseful moments.It does a great job with the horror elements and designs. There are a few highly memorable scenes with maximum creepiness. And the whole cast gives good performances.Not everything works and there are a few flaws.

There are already many good reviews here dealing with the cinematographic, technical, cultural etc aspects of this film, so I won't add anything new there. This is not about the film, but about you, the potential viewer.As many other reviewers, I've seen a significant amount of ""extreme"" or strong horror movies. Fear and shock are powerful emotions, and films are a safe and entertaining way of experiencing them. Some of them left a deep impression in me, sometimes for a few days, but that eventually vanishes.With this film, it's a different story. It may leave permanent scars in your mind that will ruin some of the best experiences of your life, such as witnessing the birth of your child or lying in bed caressing a son's hair. Violent and obscene thoughts will keep intruding, and it's scary for me to think how much this can affect some people. If you think that you may belong to this group, don't risk it. There are many good films out there, and you may go on living without watching this one.

Alien,8.5,"['Sigourney Weaver', 'Tom Skerritt', 'John Hurt', 'Veronica Cartwright', 'Harry Dean Stanton']",Ridley Scott,1979.0,horror,"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror.

If you love the movie, you will love the show! What makes the show better than the movie comes down to the episodic nature of television. The episodic format means plot-lines can begin and end more quickly than the movie, characters can be developed more and they can be thrown into a wider variety of crazy situations. The movie had great world-building but could only do so much with an 85 minute runtime, and the show furthers that simply from having more time.The show would not work if Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, who wrote/directed/acted in the movie, were not onboard.

The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie.

Enter Nick (Sam Buchanan) who works for music mogul Simon Fuller and she is, after an initial bit of hostility, signed up and on her way. The remainder of the chronology is all pretty straightforward as Sam Taylor-Johnson decides to focus on an entirely speculative look at how her personal life developed. Amy's increasingly strained relationship with her friends and her father, her grandmother's terminal illness and her ""toxic co-dependent"" relationship with the charismatic Blake (Jack O'Connell). There's no doubting that many of her songs are great, and hats off to Abela for putting her own slant on them. She does her own singing and though she does rather over-egg it, she does imbue a sense of the sheer force of personality this woman had. O'Connell, too, does well enough - especially with his Shangri-La dance in the pub when they meet, but somehow the whole narrative is just too bitty and episodic. The presentation of her character is way too shallow and frankly she is portrayed as a bit of an obnoxious brat. Her increasing exposure to the hounding paparazzi is well illustrated and that growing sense of exasperation obvious, but again we jump around too much as we seem to be rushing to conclusion we know all about. At two hours it is too long in many ways and too short in others. The dialogue offers us little insight into just who she was and by the end, I felt sad for her but can't say I really cared about any of them. The aggression of the photographers seems to receive a disproportionate share of the blame for her predicament whilst rather discounting her own series of bad choices fuelled by her own immaturity and by the public's obsessions with watching what it builds up come crashing down. They couldn't sell their photos if we didn't want to buy them. A great musical legacy left behind by one who, along with so many other ground-breaking, but flawed, musical geniuses, might just have been better left for our ears.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21261712/?ref_=sr_i_3

Bob Marley: One Love,6.4,"['Kingsley Ben-Adir', 'Lashana Lynch', 'James Norton', 'Tosin Cole', 'Umi Myers']",Reinaldo Marcus Green,2024.0,music,"A Marley fan, I went in worried having read the critics reviews ultimately saying it's ""ok"" with some great performances but a missed opportunity as it's bubblegum Marley.I disagree, this was a compelling and entertaining movie, sure there is some rich material that was left untapped, but it would take a Netflix series to unwrap his life - one day maybe!Endorsed by and produced by the Marley family, it's clear that they wanted it to be about hope, love, unity and the making of his definitive album; Exodus. But they also did touch on some of the tougher material - but maybe didn't dwell on it as much as the critics would like. We don't witness his ill health and death, but do we really need to? I don't think so.Lots of references and small touches that will resonate with those who know his story well, that may be missed by others. If you know, you know and that adds an extra layer, but none of that knowledge is needed to enjoy the movie.The soundtrack is of course fantastic and acts as a narrative through the movie, there is emotion, joy and a clear mission.A very well executed, and acted, biopic that although pulls a few punches, doesn't fail to entertain and give the viewer a window into Marley. Yes it leaves you wanting more...but thats fine by me. Come on Netflix :)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8521778/?ref_=sr_i_5
Priscilla,6.6,"['Cailee Spaeny', 'Jacob Elordi', 'Ari Cohen', 'Dagmara Dominczyk', 'Tim Post']",Sofia Coppola,2023.0,music,"Just rather uninteresting, on film terms at least.It is interesting seeing the film portray a different type of version of Elvis Presley, one that is uncomfortable to watch unfold but one that ought to be told. That's where anything noteworthy I have to say about this release ends, though. As a movie, it's rather boring. I'm not convinced there's enough to be told across a full blown picture, at least not one around 1hr 45mins in length. I will say that Cailee Spaeny puts in a solid display as the titular character, in fairness.Jacob Elordi as Elvis, in my opinion, isn't a positive to be honest. If I didn't know he was playing Elvis I genuinely wouldn't have guessed he was playing the singer, aside from a few outfits and the twisty bit of hair in his fringe. Accent particularly seemed off to me too, Elordi amusingly (given the director's connection) sounds more like Nicolas Cage (c. 1997, 'Con Air', Cameron Poe) on phone call scenes.It's competently put together visually at least, though overall I can't honestly say this made a mark on me personally. I don't feel like I learnt anything about 'Priscilla' herself. I doubt I'll remember this one long term, sadly.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22041854/?ref_=sr_i_6
La La Land,8.0,"['Ryan Gosling', 'Emma Stone', 'Rosemarie DeWitt', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Amiee Conn']",Damien Chazelle,2016.0,music,"This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/?ref_=sr_i_7

I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.Excellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.A well deserved 8/10 from me.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/?ref_=sr_i_8
Whiplash,8.5,"['Miles Teller', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Melissa Benoist', 'Paul Reiser', 'Austin Stowell']",Damien Chazelle,2014.0,music,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/?ref_=sr_i_9

Robot Dreams,7.6,"['Ivan Labanda', 'Albert Trifol Segarra', 'Rafa Calvo', 'Jos√© Garc√≠a Tos', 'Jos√© Luis Mediavilla']",Pablo Berger,2023.0,music,"Didn't know actually what I'm about to see, but the animation in the poster caught my eyes. I've also noticed its nomination for this year's Oscar awards, for animated movie, so this also caught my eyes. I wrapped the wife and kids and went to see the screening on a small cinema room with beanbags (and other kids on them) all over the floor.It started with no words, so the kids immediately noticed this fact and reported about it. It continued with images, fabulous soundtrack and tones of sensitivity, which you cannot ignore, whether you are a kid or a grown up. No need to say any word to understand the loneliness of one dog, who live in New York of the 80's.No need also to understand what one robot is bringing to his life, once he is connected and working. The entire noisy and colorful environment is not capable to give this dog half of what cold tin robot can supply. And then they get separated and the movie changes in two directions: the real world and the fantasy world - both demonstrate the longing and yearning to any contact. From both sides.The movie's rhythm is just ecstatic and is part of wide spectrum of colors, images and type of animals and figures that appears in it. The music is one part of the success that wraps this production. The heart worming story and how it ends are other parts that just work great.On the downside, the core of the movie is not a presentation of the friendship, but the will to get it back and how to fill the void, while searching for it. Doesn't always seem related, but It is so well crafted, so it didn't bother me to the actual movie flow - not a little bit and especially when kids of others caught my attention and jumped around to ruin the fluidity of the movie - externally.It is definitely the material for the Oscars - a non-mainstream big studio movie that has New York in a nus shell. Its like a Woody Allen picture, without the whining and neurotic main character, which is played by Allen himself. It's a special movie and one you definitely don't want to miss - whether it wins the Oscar or not.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13429870/?ref_=sr_i_11

When first aired the show seemed fresh, and although many skits bombed, the ones that didn't more than made up for it. If Eddie Murphy hadn't been in the next cast change, SNL probably would have ended in the early '80s. The third iteration with Dennis Miller, Carvey, Lovits and Myers was the best cast in the show's run. The fourth change-up saw ratings slump with dull routines by Ferrell, Shannon et al, and the slide has continued..it now takes a cast of 20 to try where 7 formerly succeeded. There are exceptions. Tina Fey & Kate McKinnon are often brilliant. Jost & Che are good.

A Star Is Born,7.6,"['Lady Gaga', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Sam Elliott', 'Greg Grunberg', 'Andrew Dice Clay']",Bradley Cooper,2018.0,music,"Had heard nothing but great things about this latest 'A Star is Born' film, with even my own sister saying it was a must see. There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my ""seeing as many 2018 films as possible"" quest.This is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching ""The Man That Got Away""), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and ""Evergreen"" is to die for.As far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.It's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.The final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.What 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.Visually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as ""The Man That Got Away"" and ""Evergreen"" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. ""I'll Never Love Again"" and ""Shallow"" stand out.Dialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.Altogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517451/?ref_=sr_i_13
Elvis,7.3,"['Tom Hanks', 'Austin Butler', 'Olivia DeJonge', 'Helen Thomson', 'Richard Roxburgh']",Baz Luhrmann,2022.0,music,"Compared to other musical biopics that have hit the screen in recent years (Rocket Man, Bohemian Rhapsody), 'Elvis' is tad underwhelming. It is a solid film but Luhrmann's direction failed to fully draw me in and impress.There is a lot to like about this film however. Austin Butler gives a truly terrific performance and thoroughly shines in the role. He is so charismatic and really embodies everything that Elvis was. Hanks on the other hand is reduced to a bit of a caricature which really didn't work for me. A shame as I am normally a huge fan of Hanks but felt like this casting was a little off.Perhaps the biggest draw back for me was the style of film making. The opening 30-40 minutes were very chaotic. The non-linear story telling made the opening act feel unnecessarily messy. Once things were unravelled and we started progressing through Elvis' life chronologically, things somehow felt drawn out yet fleeting at the same time. I think Luhrmann missed the mark on this one a bit.I also would have liked to have seen more from a musical perspective. At times the film had the wrong focus and I think it failed to capture just how and why Elvis became the icon he was.Despite this the film does a good job of exploring over 20 years of Elvis' life, which is no mean feat. There are some fantastic sequences and brilliant costume work throughout.Elvis is a solid film and there is a lot to enjoy, but I was expecting more and feel like with such an interesting story to tell this film could have and should have been better.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3704428/?ref_=sr_i_14
Dirty Dancing,7.0,"['Patrick Swayze', 'Jennifer Grey', 'Jerry Orbach', 'Cynthia Rhodes', 'Jack Weston']",Emile Ardolino,1987.0,music,"Is the movie predictable? Does it ooze with Cliches? Might it annoy you with its romantic/soft tones? Well the latter question is one only you can answer ... the other ones are quite easy to answer. No matter if you like the movie or not ... but it is beloved for many reasons. One that is not mentioned enough is the soundtrack! Just great songs all the way through.The other obvious reasons are the main actors/characters. You have Patrick Swayze - the hot rebel ... hard on the inside, soft as cotton on the inside. So frail that some men may have quite a few issues with him. But this is not aimed at any macho loving public - this is aimed at women! And their fantasy - most of them that is, because as with men you can't say they are all the same.The fact that this man, who seems so full of confidence has no idea ... makes him more than attractive to women ... and some men of course. Let's not forget about them as well. So while you can dissect this really easy ... you can also just enjoy the romp - and maybe carry a watermelon ... although you probably are more likely to get excited about the nobody puts baby in the corner line ... if you don't get goosebumps towards the end ... well it is an indication that you probably won't like the movie as much.A clash of rich and poor ... of sex through dance ... those motions ... those hip movements ... there was a time where this was not only dirty dancing, but also illegal dancing ... good thing we do not live in a time like that, right?

But, I was unbelievably surprised. Every kind of humour is covered here, and done to absolute perfection. You will be adopting many, many of the lines into your daily lexicon.

Amadeus,8.4,"['F. Murray Abraham', 'Tom Hulce', 'Elizabeth Berridge', 'Roy Dotrice', 'Simon Callow']",Milos Forman,1984.0,music,"At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/?ref_=sr_i_21
Almost Famous,7.9,"['Billy Crudup', 'Patrick Fugit', 'Kate Hudson', 'Frances McDormand', 'Jason Lee']",Cameron Crowe,2000.0,music,"There was a time in the US rock circuit before music videos and online marketing. That was the time when several little-known bands toured all over the country... accompanied mostly by drugs and groupies. Writer-director Cameron Crowe takes us to that infamous scene of sex, drugs and rock n' roll in the 1970's with this semi-autobiographical work, which is not only equipped with his brilliant direction and screenplay, but also by decent performances by some relatively lesser-known actors.Here the introduction of a not-too-famous band, an imaginary one called Stillwater, was important. In that sense, Stillwater is a perfect work by Crowe... with a volatile relationship between the vocalist and the guitarist, with a noncompetent manager and everything that comes with. There were also the groupies, who became a matter of substance in Crowe's point of view. But the most extraordinary thing that Crowe did is the image of himself as a 15-year-old writing prodigy, rock journalist William Miller. The viewers watch the movie through Miller's eyes. The character is extremely well-designed and reserved by Crowe. Miller's the one who becomes able to attach all the parts into a complete movie alone.Billy Crudup was probably the best among the actors as guitarist Russell Hammond. It's true his role was not a tough one, but he's the one who made it look so easy. Young Kate Hudson, as Penny Lane, is perfect and very adorable. She showed her potentials in this movie which seemed even better than her mother, Goldie Hawn. All she needs are decent roles in future. The other actors, namely Jason Lee as vocalist Jeff, Frances McDormand as Williams's over-protective mother and the other band-aids (with Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) performed also quite well. And newcomer Patrick Fugit, as Miller himself, is really brilliant. Gaining more screen time than anyone else, it was a tough test for Fugit and it is all praises for him.The soundtrack was very good with some fine original songs. There may be some minor flaws in the movie, like some unnecessary sequences, but all over this is a quite masterful work... a feast for the mind and soul, both for a hard rock n' roll fan and for casual viewers.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/?ref_=sr_i_22
The Pianist,8.5,"['Adrien Brody', 'Thomas Kretschmann', 'Frank Finlay', 'Emilia Fox', 'Michal Zebrowski']",Roman Polanski,2002.0,music,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Herv√© de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/?ref_=sr_i_23

With so few good comedies these days, it was pure joy to laugh out loud a few times during this Jack Black showcase. Is he over the top? Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem ""Dazed and Confused"") uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White (""The Good Girl"") also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332379/?ref_=sr_i_26

Yes, there's lots of smoking (and drinking and other things). That's what went on in the 70's. What we also have incredible chemistry between the characters and a glimpse into a culture that seemed only a dream for working class garage band kids growing up in the 70's, it's fascinating to see the music industry from the perspective of pre-computer musicians who only wanted to have fun and jam real music and showed (at least on stage and creatively) little interest in the goings on in the outside world. Daisy is a talented, yet free spirited loner wild child on a path to self destructive addiction; Billy is an intense and conflicted genius, as he tries to balance his family life with the RnR lifestyle. It's clear they can't live with, or without, each other. The entire band is somewhat of a disfunctional family, but they are family. It has a soap opera feel, emotions are expressed in song.

I have always had a deep interest in censorship, be it of film, music, art or any freedom of expression.I approached this film with the hope that it had been passed by the censors because it had some kind of beautiful message or story to tell. That the overall worth of the film had outweighed the controversy of the sexual content and it was such a well made film that to deny it a release would have been an injustice to film making.But I was deeply disappointed. If you take away the explicit content of the film, it has nothing. It says nothing. It goes nowhere.It has no particular storyline or insight to offer, the sex scenes are all it has to carry it. Without that it becomes nothing but a collection of badly filmed concert footage. As for the musical artists chosen, they are like the film..for twenty-somethings who think they are being daring and are pushing the boundaries, but are walking the safest path right down the middle of the road.The characters are not developed at all, and what you do see and learn of them makes them instantly unlikable. Neither are they particularly attractive- which makes the sexual content unpleasant to watch. It may be (slightly) graphic but those people watching only for the hope of a sexual thrill will also be very disappointed. I would much rather have seen this film without the graphic sexual content, and a more satisfying storyline exploring the relationship between the couple. As it is, it just lets you down in all areas. It is put forward as a unique insight into a couples love making, but comes across as the cold, functional sex of a one night stand. There is not the passion, or the intensity, of a genuine loving relationship.The film needed to be longer, to give time to develop the characters or some kind of story and give the viewer something to grasp. The sixty six minutes running time leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" and wanting a refund- both of the money paid for the film and the hour of your life you just wasted. It will remain notorious for its sexual content, and continue to appeal to those who have not seen it. Once seen, it loses any appeal.This film is most likely to end up being passed around schools by thirteen year old boys and skipped to the sex scenes, or more likely the sex scenes downloaded from a peer to peer network.I suppose the whole film does have one thing, an element of realism. It is like watching a very expensively filmed home video but as everyone knows other peoples lives may seem interesting at a distance, but close up they are just as boring as your own.In this case, dull is an understatement.Maybe that is the point..but if this film does have one, it is very cleverly disguised.I really wanted to like this film. I really wanted it to be the ground breaking, brave, work of artistic genius that the media promised.That this was the film that would open the gates for a more honest era of censorship.It isn't any of those things, the most interesting thing about it is the question of how it was given a certificate..the biggest question is why bother making it in the first place?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411705/?ref_=sr_i_33
Wish,5.6,"['Ariana DeBose', 'Chris Pine', 'Alan Tudyk', 'Angelique Cabral', 'Victor Garber']",Chris Buck,2023.0,musical,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304740/?ref_=sr_i_1
Wonka,7.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Gustave Die', 'Murray McArthur', 'Paul G. Raymond', 'Bertie Caplan']",Paul King,2023.0,musical,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/?ref_=sr_i_2

Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film.

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,7.8,"['Gene Wilder', 'Jack Albertson', 'Peter Ostrum', 'Roy Kinnear', 'Julie Dawn Cole']",Mel Stuart,1971.0,musical,"The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures. But ultimately it's the story and the way it appeals to every age group that makes Willy Wonka a prize treasure, the kids love it, while the adults watching with them will be wryly nodding and trying to suppress the onset of a devilish grin.Pure magic is Willy Wonka, see it now in High Definition TV to fully realise the dream/nightmare on offer, oh oh I love it so. 10/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/?ref_=sr_i_8
La La Land,8.0,"['Ryan Gosling', 'Emma Stone', 'Rosemarie DeWitt', 'J.K.

Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/?ref_=sr_i_9
Easter Parade,7.3,"['Judy Garland', 'Fred Astaire', 'Peter Lawford', 'Ann Miller', 'Jules Munshin']",Charles Walters,1948.0,musical,"Originally intended as a re-teaming of Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, EASTER PARADE ran into trouble when Garland's doctors advised against her working under the direction of her husband, director Vincent Minnelli--and no sooner did director Charles Walters take the helm than Gene Kelly broke his leg. Out of such confusion are movie musical miracles born: although a bit old to act as Garland's leading man, Fred Astaire was coaxed out of retirement. He and Garland had tremendous chemistry, EASTER PARADE was a box office smash, and Astaire unexpectedly found himself reborn as an MGM star.Set in 1900s New York, the film's story line is flimsy but enjoyable. After long-time dance partner Ann Miller abandons the act, Astaire hires chorus girl Garland and attempts to recast her in his former partner's mold--a situation which offers Astaire and Garland considerable comedy and gives Astaire the chance to parody several of his own famous dance of the 1930s. Garland eventually convinces Astaire that she needs to be herself, and once the act is revamped they become a hot ticket--and, once their several romantic complications are resolved, romantic partners as well.Astaire is every bit as charming here as he was in his Ginger Roger days, and his choreography retains his signature sharpness, wit, and elegance. Although Garland isn't really a dancer, she holds her own with Astaire and she tears strips off a brilliant score of Irving Berlin favorites. Both are well supported by Anne Miller, who gives a brilliant turn with 'Shakin' the Blues Away,' and Peter Lawford, who is quite charming as one of Garland's admirers. Although this really isn't as inspired as the truly great MGM musicals of the late 1940s, director Walters keeps it going at a smart pace, and the star power, clever script, memorable score, and those legendary MGM production values elevate it well above the pack. Musical fans will be in for a treat! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040308/?ref_=sr_i_10
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,6.7,"['Johnny Depp', 'Freddie Highmore', 'David Kelly', 'Helena Bonham Carter', 'Noah Taylor']",Tim Burton,2005.0,musical,"Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original ""Willy Wonka"" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts.

Jesus Christ Superstar,7.4,"['Ted Neeley', 'Carl Anderson', 'Yvonne Elliman', 'Barry Dennen', 'Bob Bingham']",Norman Jewison,1973.0,musical,"The Lloyd-Webber and Rice musical comes to the screen, and is nothing like the stage show at all.  The deserts are real, although the back story is that this is a theatre company, putting on a production in real locations.The cast are largely session singers and unknowns - Ted Neeley, delicate and high-voiced as Jesus (particularly superb in `Gethsemane'); Carl Anderson, black and doe-eyed as Judas with hot soul vocals, Barry Dennen as Pilate, and Yvonne Elliman as Magdelene with her big number `I Don't Know How To Love Him'.One loss for those who know the stage version is being removed from the crucifixion preamble, when the ghost of Judas sings `Superstar' - this was all video camera projection in the theatre, while in the movie we are detached observers.  But at other times we get uncomfortably close.  And the songs survive the transportation to a more realistic setting (except the added `Could We Start Again, Please?' which sounds rather too much like the Coca-Cola theme for comfort).Best scenes?

The Wizard of Oz,8.1,"['Judy Garland', 'Frank Morgan', 'Ray Bolger', 'Bert Lahr', 'Jack Haley']",Victor Fleming,1939.0,musical,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this fine production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/?ref_=sr_i_14
Godspell: A Musical Based on the Gospel According to St,6.5,"['Victor Garber', 'Lynne Thigpen', 'Katie Hanley', 'David Haskell', 'Merrell Jackson']",David Greene,1973.0,musical,"Let me start this review by saying that I'm not a Christian and I don't believe you have to be one to enjoy this movie. I first saw Godspell when it was released in the early '70's and have seen it many times since then.I was having a conversation with a friend recently (he is a pastor) and I told him that I've always felt this movie wasn't made solely for Christians. In the 70's, there were a lot of young people looking for meaning in their lives, and I firmly believe Godspell was partially an attempt to reach out to those folks.Many reviewers have had issues with the movie - John the Baptist and Judas are played by the same person, and while the crucifixion is addressed, the resurrection is not. Some have called it sacrilegious, others have found it offensive. However, if you were a young person in the 70's who was looking for some direction and wanted to find out about the basic teachings of Jesus Christ, what better way than to see a movie full of catchy pop songs and a cast of joyful young people being brought to him in (then) modern New York? Even if you were already a young Christian, you now had a way to celebrate the teachings of Christ with a style of music you were probably listening to anyway. I absolutely believe that this movie had a relatability that might have been missing in some of these people's lives. Bear in mind that the original stage version was written by a college student working on his masters.Yes, the movie is dated and silly and overacted and hammy in parts. There is a lot of skipping, singing, acting out of parables and dancing going on while most cast members are wearing clownish outfits. All of that being said, I have never seen such heartfelt joy while a message was being given - the cast looks like they are having the time of their lives. The mood does become quite somber and sad towards the end, but the movie ends on an upbeat note of hope.If I'm not mistaken, all of the cast members were unknown on the big screen when the movie was released. I think casting unknowns was a good move - I don't think it would have packed the same punch or had the same level of relatability if it had bigger names. I wanted to make a comment regarding the song ""Beautiful City"". I don't know what the original meaning was for sure, but my take away from it has always been that now that the cast has been taught, they can spread the word to others and help them build a strong foundation that isn't made of alabaster and chrome. Some have thought the song wasn't appropriate for the movie - I guess it all depends on your interpretation. So taken in the proper cultural perspective, Godspell is a powerful, uplifting and moving film about the basic teachings and crucifixion of Christ done '70s style. If you think you can get past the few discrepancies and the clownish clothing, it is worth a watch. And, again, you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070121/?ref_=sr_i_15
Moana,7.6,"[""Auli'i Cravalho"", 'Dwayne Johnson', 'Rachel House', 'Temuera Morrison', 'Jemaine Clement']",Directors,2016.0,musical,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164/?ref_=sr_i_16

The Greatest Showman,7.5,"['Hugh Jackman', 'Michelle Williams', 'Zac Efron', 'Zendaya', 'Rebecca Ferguson']",Michael Gracey,2017.0,musical,"To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1485796/?ref_=sr_i_18

I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/?ref_=sr_i_19

I went in with an open mind; not having read any reviews, so had no preconceptions.It started off OK, pretty visuals, but I quickly realised (within the first 10 minutes or so) that this was some cringe-worthy, self-indulgent, vanity project (thank goodness for the fast forward button!!!)I did press 'play' at regular intervals to see if (by some miracle) things had improved, but no... my time & intellect was wasting away with each passing minute!!!! ...Dramatic? Nope; it really was THAT bad!!!

Sing 2,7.3,"['Matthew McConaughey', 'Reese Witherspoon', 'Scarlett Johansson', 'Tori Kelly', 'Taron Egerton']",Garth Jennings,2021.0,musical,"The first 'Sing' was very enjoyable, despite one annoying character (Mike), the predictability and trying to do too much it was also wonderfully animated with equally wonderful music and mostly successful in writing and characters. While the advertising looked good and trusted friends were raving about 'Sing 2', there was a little apprehension as animated sequels are often badly executed and pointless ('The Secret of NIMH 2 for example) though there are some exceptions like 'Shrek 2' and the second and third 'Toy Story' films.'Sing 2' turned out to be every bit as charming, as entertaining and as delightful as the first, and to me it was actually even better. It has all the first film's good things executed even better, while having richer character development and writing. It also seemed took on board the common criticisms the first had of having too many characters and too much going on, while with plenty going on. It is also more straightforward and there were no pointless or annoying characters here. Mike doesn't appear here and he is not missed.It may be lacking in the originality and momentum dips a little with the Meena subplot.Porsha's change of heart is also a little on the rushed side.However, the animation is wonderful, it's bright, colourful, rich in detail and with slick character designs with more imaginative visuals in the musical numbers. Which are absolutely terrific, especially the absolute firecracker that is the opening. ""I Still Haven't Found What I Am Looking For"" is going to stick in the memory for a long time and reduced me to tears. The character writing is richer, especially for Johnny (still relatable, more so) and even more so Calloway, the most interesting character and also a realistic and easy to identify with one. Porsha is also an absolute hoot and Crystal is a villain (Illumination's best, darkest and most realistic villain by some considerable distance) that absolutely nobody wants to mess with or get on the wrong side of.Furthermore, 'Sing 2' is superior in the writing. A lot of moments induced a lot of loud out loud laughter (ie. The auditions, Miss Crawley's encounter with Calloway), others brought a tear to the eyes (Calloway walking down the stairs with only Ash's singing being heard) and there was plenty of uplifting hope in the absolutely spectacular final act, which made the writing feel very feel good. The story is predictable, but the energy is truly infectious and razor sharp without feeling rushed. Like the character writing, the storytelling is richer emotionally and has a good deal more depth. Notably the whole Calloway storyline. Of the character relationships, faring best are the scary tension between Buster and Crystal, Johnny and super cool Nooshi and the tender, heartfelt one between Ash and Calloway.All the voice acting is spot on as well and the singing performances are exemplary, all the original voice actors return and have lost none of what made them so good in the first. Bono's casting was truly genius and he brought a lot of amusement and heart to Calloway. Bobby Cannavale is often truly unnerving as Crystal, especially when the character's ruthlessness darkens and becomes more dangerous without ever being too overkill. Halsey's quirkiness is truly adorable and entertaining.Concluding, so much better than expected and very well done. 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6467266/?ref_=sr_i_22

The changes to the songs are ridiculous, the original lyrics weren't problematic in the slightest.Scuttle's voice is really jarring and the added song is just bad.The changes made to the ending make the story worse, not better.

The Prince of Egypt,7.2,"['Val Kilmer', 'Ralph Fiennes', 'Michelle Pfeiffer', 'Sandra Bullock', 'Jeff Goldblum']",Brenda Chapman,1998.0,musical,"Quite possibly the most astonishing achievement in animation since Beauty and the Beast (and surpassing same), The Prince of Egypt is a lovingly crafted, engaging piece of cinema.  The main characters are well-realized, three-dimensional characters.  The focus of the film is the conflict between Ramses and his adopted brother, Moses, set against the backdrop of the epic events in the book of Exodus.  The result is a religious tale that treats the oft-ignored human element.  Instead of merely relating the tale as it is, the story asks ""how would a person *feel* if God appeared to them and told them to do this?  How would others react?""  The script is light-years beyond any past biblical epic. The animation style owes a small debt to Disney's house style, but goes above and beyond in the details in character design (the Hebrews and Egyptians and Midians are clearly of different ethnic backgrounds, and no character suffers from the doe-eyed Disney Belle syndrome).   Computer Generated Imagery blends -- for the first time in an animated film -- seamlessly with traditional cel animation.  The film also takes some fairly audacious risks; Moses has a dream sequence in stiffly animated hieroglyphics, completely switching animation styles for about five minutes, which I believe is completely unprecedented in animation.  There are moments when the visual effects made me forget to breathe.  If you blink during the parting of the red sea, you'll regret it.  There is, I believe I can safely say, not a second of the film that does not offer some sort of visual delight -- from the deep symbolism of the hieroglyphics to the dizzying chariot race in the opening sequence. The music has been touted by some critics as the film's weak link; such is definitely not the case.  Stephen Schwartz' songs combine elements of Broadway-esque show tunes with native Hebrew and Egyptian music.  The songs are powerful and moving, sometimes no more than one verse in length, sometimes full-blown  seven-minute extravaganzas like ""Let My People Go."" The one weaker song, surprisingly, is the theme ""When You Believe.""  Even freed from Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston R&B cheese as it is in the movie, it's a watery definition of faith at best.  Still, the scene in which it takes place is powerful and the song is beautifully performed. If the film has a weak link, it might be the voice casting,Val Kilmer and Patrick Stewart in particular.  The two voices are distinctive of the gentleman who possess them, and thus are distracting in this format.  But such is a minor quibble, and should not dissuade anyone from seeing the greatest animated story ever told.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/?ref_=sr_i_26

The Color Purple,6.9,"['Fantasia Barrino', 'Taraji P.

emotional aspect of the 1985 movie and that the songs in the movie interrupted the flow of the story.It's the same story of a black Southern woman Celie struggling to find her identity after suffering abuse from her father and abusive husband over four decades .Celie with the help of her sisters and an unexpected inheritance escape her abusive husband and is reunited with her stolen children.I felt the emotional impact was trivialised or diminished a little by adding music and songs to the mix.The ensemble cast is impressive headed by Fantasia Barrino as Celie the role that Whoopi Goldberg who has a cameo in this version received a Best Actress Oscar nomination in 1986. The role of Sophia played excellently in this version by Danielle Brooks also earned Oprah Winfrey an Oscar nomination in 1986 for her portrayal of Sophia.Other impressive performances from Taraji P. Henson as the flamboyant Shug Avery and Colman Domingo as the menacing Mister helped make The Colour Purple entertaining for me .Oprah Winfrey is co producer with Steven Spielberg who directed the 1986 version.This version directed by Blitz Bazawule
cost an estimated $USD 100,000,000 to bring to the screen .The original 1986 version cost an estimated $15,000,000 and was a huge success grossing $ 98,500,000 it will be interesting to see how the musical film version performs at the box office.The Colour Purple musical version for me was like attending an Evangelical Baptist revival meeting where sinners repent and are miraculously transformed ,it's a little too preachy for me.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1200263/?ref_=sr_i_29

The Sound of Music,8.1,"['Julie Andrews', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Eleanor Parker', 'Richard Haydn', 'Peggy Wood']",Robert Wise,1965.0,musical,"This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as ""Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?"" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, ""If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you."" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (""Seven Brides..."", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""...Molly Brown"", ""The Music Man"", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of ""The Sound of Music"". The film has it all.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/?ref_=sr_i_31

Tangled,7.7,"['Mandy Moore', 'Zachary Levi', 'Donna Murphy', 'Ron Perlman', 'M.C. Gainey']",Nathan Greno,2010.0,musical,"I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/?ref_=sr_i_33
Grease,7.2,"['John Travolta', 'Olivia Newton-John', 'Stockard Channing', 'Jeff Conaway', 'Barry Pearl']",Randal Kleiser,1978.0,musical,"The movie has proved more durable than anyone would have thought. It took substantial critical hits for being a Califoria-ized, Olivia-Newton-John-ized adaptation of a beloved, long-running New York show. At least, we mused at the time, they changed the story so they wouldn't have to make Ms Newton-John affect any sort of American accent: certainly not a New York one.And yet it seems to stand up well on its own. The New Yorker observed at the time that nobody involved with this movie was alive during the era it was supposed to depict, but they clearly had a fine time with the music. Yes, the scenes were clearly from sunny 1970's California, but this didn't bother the kids who saw this in 1978, and enough time has passed that it shouldn't bother us who remember that it was supposed to be in Brooklyn, in the '50's.Have fun, kids.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077631/?ref_=sr_i_34

Les Mis√©rables,7.5,"['Hugh Jackman', 'Russell Crowe', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Amanda Seyfried', 'Sacha Baron Cohen']",Tom Hooper,2012.0,musical,"Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matin√©e ‚Äì the theater was packed ‚Äì applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled. Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering on screen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, ""This is only a movie"" even as tears streamed down my cheeks. Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, ""You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave."" They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's ""Barge Haulers on the Volga."" Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises ¬Ö you get the idea. A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of ""Les Miserables."" I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen ‚Äì they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive. I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. ""Les Miserable"" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy. I think ""Les Miserables"" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When ""Les Miserable"" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on, I can, too! I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones, ""I dreamed a dream"" and ""Do you hear the people sing?"" All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1707386/?ref_=sr_i_36
Aladdin,6.9,"['Will Smith', 'Mena Massoud', 'Naomi Scott', 'Marwan Kenzari', 'Navid Negahban']",Guy Ritchie,2019.0,musical,"Considering the director was having trouble and the studio was working against a well loved classic. Plus a few other things, they pulled of a watchable film. Still forgettable but watchable. Maybe I am super impressed by this film because of how awful Dumbo was. Who knows.

Hercules,7.3,"['Tate Donovan', 'Susan Egan', 'James Woods', 'Barbara Barrie', 'Roger Bart']",Ron Clements,1997.0,musical,"Although I know I have heaped praise on several other Disney films...Hercules stands out as my favourite among them all. After this movie the Disney features once again seemed to slip downhill. However I can watch this movie again and again, it has a spectacular Greek chorus, gospel type score, which will ring in your head for days (and you will like it!). The characters are all likeable, even the villain and it is absolutely hilarious!I have never understood the panning this film got from Disney fans, as I have never comprehended what there is to dislike. The animation is beautifully done, although it is done in the style of Greek art, which may not be to everyone's taste (very similar situation to Sleeping Beauty which was disliked by some because it was animated in the style of a medieval tapestry), but it works wonderfully for the film.Take a chance and watch it...and when you're done watching it for the sixteenth time, go out and buy the soundtrack!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119282/?ref_=sr_i_38
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,6.6,"['Lily James', 'Amanda Seyfried', 'Meryl Streep', 'Cher', 'Andy Garcia']",Ol Parker,2018.0,musical,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 10 years since director Phyllida Lloyd presented the crowd-pleasing MAMMA MIA! movie. It was a box office hit (over $600 million worldwide) and was, for a few years, the highest grossing musical of all-time. Most importantly, it was extremely entertaining and a joyous cinematic romp for viewers. This year's sequel is directed by Ol Parker (THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL and husband to actress Thandie Newton), and though the melancholy is slathered on a bit too thick, it also fulfills its number one priority - entertaining the fans.The story begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) putting the final touches on the house-turned-hotel in preparation for the upcoming Grand Opening. It's named Hotel Bella Donna in honor of Sophie's mother (Meryl Streep). What looks to be a straight-forward story surprises us with a flashback to Donna's 1979 graduation, which features not only the first song-and-dance number ""When I Kissed the Teacher"", but also the first of two ABBA cameos ... Bjorn Ulvaeus as a professor. The young Donna is played brilliantly by Lily James, and she effortlessly captures the free-spiritedness that led to the conundrum of the first movie - 3 possible dads for Sophie.Those 3 dads return not only as Pierce Brosnan (Sam), Stellan Skarsgard (Bill), and Colin Firth (Harry), but also as Jeremy Irvine (young Sam), Josh Dylan (young Bill), and Hugh Skinner (young Harry). In fact, most of the run time is dedicated to the backstory of these characters and how they first met as youngsters. Each has a segment (and song) with young Harry featured in ""Waterloo"" accompanied by Benny Andersson (ABBA cameo #2) on piano. Young Bill is the charming sailor who saves the day for Donna, while young Sam assists her with saving a storm-shaken horse (kind of humorous since Mr. Irvine starred in WAR HORSE).  Also back are Dominic Cooper as Sky, Sophie's true love, who can't decide between romance and career, and Donna's life-long friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters), who are also part of the flashback as Jessica Keenan Wynn (excellent as young Tanya) and Alexa Davies (as young Rosie). New to the cast are Celia Imrie in the graduation number, Andy Garcia as the hotel manager, and drawing the biggest applause of all ... Cher as Sophie's grandmother (and as my viewing partner commented, an early peek at what Lady Gaga will look like as a grandma)! It's best if you experience Cher for yourself, and it should be noted that this is her first big screen appearance since BURLESQUE in 2010.Of course, the songs are key and many of the ABBA numbers from the first movie are featured again this time. In particular, ""Dancing Queen"" is a nautical standout, and ""Fernando"" is a show-stopper. While it may not be quite as raucous as the first, it's a treat watching Lily James, and there is a wonderful blending of ""old"" and ""new"" in the finale. The only real question remaining is, did the casting director do the math before casting Cher (age 72) as Meryl Streep's (age 69) mother?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6911608/?ref_=sr_i_39
Beauty and the Beast,8.0,"[""Paige O'Hara"", 'Robby Benson', 'Jesse Corti', 'Rex Everhart', 'Angela Lansbury']",Gary Trousdale,1991.0,musical,"This is a classic movie. We have breakthrough films like Snow White and Fantasia, and we have other greats like Aladdin and The Lion King, but this definitely tops them all. There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics. This film has emotion, incredible music and animation, characters that you admire, laugh at, and despise. This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives. The way we can identify with the characters sucks us into the story.

Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big! lol) and everyone else!There were some moments of course, the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you don't necessarily laugh at it,.... but OK.This is the second time Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appeared in a film together by the way, they both worked on ""Lady Jane"" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww.It's definitely worth watching, quite hilarious indeed!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107977/?ref_=sr_i_43
West Side Story,7.1,"['Ansel Elgort', 'Rachel Zegler', 'Ariana DeBose', 'David Alvarez', 'Rita Moreno']",Steven Spielberg,2021.0,musical,"My first thought in hearing about this ... a thought I'm sure was shared by many ... was WHY? Why remake a movie that was done so well the first time. Still, I went to the theater and found a wonderful, well-made movie. I hadn't read anything about the movie before seeing it and I went in wondering if they would update it to present day. They didn't, but I think that might have worked too.Discussing the movie with my twenty-something son, I brought up the ""why remake a nearly perfect film"" question and his response was ... for a new generation. People his age were never going to see the 1961 version in the theater and most would never see a 60 year old movie at all. This movie allows a new generation (or two or three) to experience the magic on the big screen. Ultimately, the appeal of the movie lies in the music and the dance ... even more than the story. But the story is still powerful even after there have been so very many Romeo and Juliet adaptations.A fun movie to see on the big screen.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581652/?ref_=sr_i_44
Moulin Rouge!,7.6,"['Nicole Kidman', 'Ewan McGregor', 'John Leguizamo', 'Jim Broadbent', 'Richard Roxburgh']",Baz Luhrmann,2001.0,musical,"You can't compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge, because they share, really, nothing besides the fact that people sing and dance. Moulin Rouge stands alone. I really love this movie.Nicole Kidman did sorta over act in parts (the Elephant scene, and when she tells Zidler she wants to leave.), but other than that, the acting is wonderful. I just love Ewan McGregor's character, and I love Ewan McGregor. John Leguizamo's character, Henri Toulouse Lautrec (yes, the famous painter), I found was just such an annoyingly funny character, he was definently one of my favorite characters. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is definently overacted, and frankly, Zidler (John Broadbent), is sooooo horribly annoying, you really would want to throw yourself off the Moulin Rouge windmill.I love this movie. There are some funny parts, but they are mostly just in the beginning, and the best musical number isn't 'Diamonds', but rather, the dramatic 'Roxanne'. Another one of my favourite pieces is 'Nature Boy', the song sung at the very beginning. It's so sad, but very touching.The beginning is sort of depressing, but it doesn't last long, so don't stop the DVD then. The middle sort of drags on, so be warned. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and very colourful, and the dancing is really Spectacular Spectacular (excuse the pun...), but long periods of time with the Bohemians, or at the Moulin Rouge can make you feel like you're stuck in a circus tent. But since Ewan McGregor's in it, I give it 10 stars.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203009/?ref_=sr_i_45
The Lion King,6.8,"['Donald Glover', 'Beyonc√©', 'Seth Rogen', 'Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'John Oliver']",Jon Favreau,2019.0,musical,"The movie is adequate, that's not good enough for this live action though. Lion King is a masterpiece story that has been celebrated for years for its emotional and timeless value. This version falls really short. The voice acting is flat the tone is wrong and there is little to no emotion felt during a very slow boring few hours.The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rohan and Billy Eisner. Past that?

So this movie was advertised to the hilt since the premier of Teen Beach 2, which was not as good as the first I might add. So after months of the advertising of the Descendants, I was fearing the worst. As much as I can't stand Cameron Boyce, I do like Dove Cameron from Liv and Maddie, which is the only show I can bear on Disney Channel.After watching this movie, I was quite surprised, also I quite enjoyed it, Dove was brilliant as the daughter of Malificent, and Evie, was quite funny too. OK, the 2 boy villains were OK too. But the idea and story were actually pretty good, and some of the characters were quite fun to watch.Also the parents of the villains were fun to watch, some of the things they say are quite amusing.As far as Disney straight to TV movies go, I'd give it a go, of course, after months of repeating the film, you'll get fed up with it.Overall watchable once or maybe 2 days later, twice, then you'll have had enough.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3440298/?ref_=sr_i_47
Labyrinth,7.3,"['David Bowie', 'Jennifer Connelly', 'Toby Froud', 'Shelley Thompson', 'Christopher Malcolm']",Jim Henson,1986.0,musical,"The first time I saw this movie was two years ago.  Don't ask me how I managed to miss it as a child but I did.It is obvious that this movie was made for the kiddies but I don't think it can just be enjoyed by the younger crowd.  I think perhaps if I had seen this as a child instead of a teenager I would have enjoyed it more but I didn't and I still enjoyed never the less.  There is something magical about watching Labyrinth.  You just feel the happiness that rubs off from this movie.  It almost makes you wish you were a kid again.  I admit seeing it now I have to say some parts are beyond corny but I think that's just part of it, I mean that was the 80's right?  I am not even a David Bowie fan but I can't help but smile whenever he starts singing (which is quite often).  I recently showed this to my 4 year old cousin and he couldn't get enough of it.  It was so great to watch him turn his head back to look at me with a giant smile to make sure I saw the puppets doing whatever they were doing at that moment.  He really loved it so I bought him the dvd for X-mas this year along with myself a copy.  This is really just one of those movies you have to see at least once in your life, just because there isn't another like it. Sure the story isn't much when it comes to plot but try to watch this film all the way through without smiling once, I dare you!A great movie for the kids or kids at heart! 8 out of 10 stars.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/?ref_=sr_i_48

READ the list of cast from start to end! You will be amazed who was in this movie! Including Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia in Star Wars), and even Steven Spielberg acted in this movie too!Everyone should be required to see this movie, as kids, teens, and adults! Every age group will enjoy this movie. NICE family movie too! The kids and adults will 100% enjoy watching it. It is sooo sad that many of those music legends are forgotten, are not taught about in any school, and remain unknown! I never knew who Ray Charles was until I finally saw this movie! Possibly the first ever movie in which the soundtrack sold as well as the movie. There is even a tribute to Elvis at the very end.

Aladdin,8.0,"['Scott Weinger', 'Robin Williams', 'Linda Larkin', 'Jonathan Freeman', 'Frank Welker']",Ron Clements,1992.0,musical,"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103639/?ref_=sr_i_50
3 Body Problem,7.7,"['Jovan Adepo', 'Liam Cunningham', 'Eiza Gonz√°lez', 'Jess Hong', 'Benedict Wong']",Creators,2024.0,mystery,"So thought-provoking. This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story.

It had so many funny lines, shocking twists, interesting plot lines revealed and everything even in just the first episode! Plus the effects are nothing to sneeze at. What I've seen so far has shown the perfect balance of dark comedy, drama, and a wonderfully oddball sci-fi, all packaged into a small town setting, which is something I've always liked. So, great acting, great scripting, great filming, I was hooked from the first few seconds and would recommend.

True Detective,8.9,"['Vince Vaughn', 'Colin Farrell', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Taylor Kitsch', 'Matthew McConaughey']",Creators,2014.0,mystery,"Watch the show and make up your own mind. I've seen too many people regurgitating the same ""SEASON 1 IS AMAZING, SEASON 2 IS THE WORST OF ALL TIME"" junk, and it's simply not true.Fact of the matter is this is an anthology series. Different people, different stories, different feels. If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015. Just goes to show that some people have no clue how to manage their expectations, and this site is no different. Look at what I've said, and now put it up against so many here...it's ridiculous.Like I said: watch it and make up your own mind. I avoided it for 5 years because of this site and I regret it. Season 2 isn't season 1, just like season 3 isn't 1 or 2. If you want the same thing over and over again, watch CSI.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/?ref_=sr_i_3

The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16418808/?ref_=sr_i_4
Monk,8.1,"['Tony Shalhoub', 'Jason Gray-Stanford', 'Ted Levine', 'Traylor Howard', 'Stanley Kamel']",Creator,2002.0,mystery,"This is written in direct protest of a user comment on this site which called this remarkable series ""drivel,"" ""awful,"" and other things that made me think the jerk was accidentally watching ""Law and Order.""This is one of the best shows on TV. I say that because it shares one common trait with every show I have ever loved: Heart. Behind the ominous tinge of death, the cynical barkings of Captain Stottlemeyer, the Barney Fife-esque antics of Randy Disher, the equal parts maternal nagging and New Jersey attitude of Charona Flemming and the fact that it's basically a show about poking fun at one guy's mental problems is love. We LOVE Adrien Monk. We join him in mourning his wife's death, and we live and die with each step he takes toward being reinstated.This is more than a cop show. This is more than a detective show. This is more than a comedy. This is more than a drama. Given the slightest amount of cosmic justice, this show will go down in history alongside ""Sports Night,"" ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (I apologize for nothing) as a show that did not give in to the horrors of professional television, but rose above them to produce pure art.As for the last guy's comment that Monk should've been reinstated a long time ago...you want to give Adrien a gun and set him loose in your neighborhood?

I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/?ref_=sr_i_6

Lost is one of my favorite shows ever and the reviews for this have been mostly positive so I figured I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. I was hooked from the first episode to the last. I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still. That's probably the only negative thing I have say about his show, that it didn't offer enough answers in the first season.

Love Lies Bleeding,7.3,"['Anna Baryshnikov', 'Kristen Stewart', 'Dave Franco', ""Katy O'Brian"", 'Jena Malone']",Rose Glass,2024.0,mystery,"My first thought was it feels like the gym was depicted in the way someone who doesn't go to the gym imagines the gym is like. Like they watched Pumping Iron instead of visiting the nearest gym. It's like if Pumping Iron was a raunchy, lesbian, blood-soaked psychedelic experience. With a dash of crime family drama.I found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it's not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it's mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good. It took me a while to realize I recognized Katy O'Brian from The Mandalorian. I loved that she was homeless but still working out; if she can get swole living under a bridge, what's your excuse? Lol.Theres a huge emphasis on smoking and drugs, it's a pretty big theme and mostly referenced on the radio. The story is alright, there's a love, crime and family drama.It's quite raunchy. I wasn't expecting that, but I suppose the movie did give off those vibes. I just didn't watch any trailers or anything and went in blind. It also included some other adult/mature content like domestic violence. It's quite gory as well. Initially, it felt like it was penned by a man; I was surprised to learn it was written/directed by a woman afterward. I recall thinking that there will probably be a lot of people commenting on this, expressing their displeasure with how women are portrayed in movies written by men.The movie had several moments where I thought to myself, well that's taken a weird turn. It gets more weird and weirder the longer in goes. It's really weird that it was common/normal back then to just hit your wife. It was jarring to watch. Franco's character is probably the worst one.It's also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it's just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love. I didn't really find myself rooting for anyone and l didn't feel particularly attached to the movie as a whole. I feel like it could've been better, and by better I mean more psychedelic, more violent, maybe even disturbing. It's not a movie for everyone, but it's pretty interesting and I enjoyed it. I like it but I don't know if it'll still be on my mind a month from now.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19637052/?ref_=sr_i_8

It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first.

I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent. Only problem is that living in England, who knows how long after it's shown in the US we'll get to see it! Fortunately it's worth the wait!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845/?ref_=sr_i_10
Avatar: The Last Airbender,7.2,"['Gordon Cormier', 'Kiawentiio', 'Ian Ousley', 'Dallas Liu', 'Paul Sun-Hyung Lee']",Creator,2024.0,mystery,"I saw many episodes of the first season of the cartoon, but not all. Back when there were no streaming services so I needed to watch it on television when I passed by chaning the channels. Through the years I got parts of the first story but never the last episode of season 1. So I am aware of the story.I also saw the movie or movies, I am not sure how many there are. Het last one was not bad, it looks like this series. So I see the battle in the north again. But I must say, it was no problem. This series is very watchable. Sometimes you have amazing shots. But overall you can see the background faded and the foreground sharp and too much light, so you see it is fake. I think the really big amazing shots cost a lot of money and even that the other scens looking fake, it is still of a high quality. I think it is also combined with real shots.I mostly like the characters, but many times I think: there is something off. Like the parents or the crazy king. Also the acting can be a bit off, like it is too static. Just like the fake backgrounds. It looks to clinical.But overall I believe the characters. The most important characters are believable for me. It also sometimes has the same sillynes as the original. The pace is also good, but I think sometimes it is going too fast. I think they take some shortcuts, but overall you get the main story. I enjoyed watching this. I am starting watching the original again, but then from season 2.So I think there should be a season 2. I do not know if I like it after I just saw the original. But I saw many horrible adapation of books, games and animation. This is a very good take. It can be a bit better, bit more clever maybe. But this is solid.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9018736/?ref_=sr_i_11

They try to analyze how to get a step ahead of these killers to catch them before they kill more. This series was so good that it went 15 seasons. Not only the 15 seasons but even though it's only been off the air for a short time, people have missed it so much that they're bringing it back later this year with the same cast. The characters are all very well written and developed throughout the show. The writers also keep the shows fresh and that's not an easy job after 15 seasons.

Another Australian story converted, yet again, to an American setting with truly obnoxious characters, trite dialogue and weak plotting. The book wasn't literature but at least provided a decent read. Sam Neil needs to give it up if this is the best he can do. What an insult - Lianne Moriarty should be hung, drawn and quartered for allowing this bastardisation of her Australian story.

The story was beyond imagination, really epic, and it's not about one single country or one single culture, you can see every nation, every race united together when facing danger. The TV series tried to make everything the same as the book. One star was deducted because the pacing of story telling, all the flashbacks and neon lights scenes are a bit annoying and confusing, when not everyone knows the background of the story.

I tried watching NBC's Medical Investigation, but it just felt and looked too corny. House is a definite improvement of Medical Investigation. It's smart and daring. I love the sarcasm and snide comments coming from Dr. House. Supporting actors are great. It's CSI-ish but quirky like Arrested Development. I hope it stays on the air. Cancel Medical Investigation but keep House. It's a good sign that FOX is pushing plenty of promos for the show, such as free DVD previews of the pilot.

Dexter,8.6,"['Michael C. Hall', 'Jennifer Carpenter', 'David Zayas', 'James Remar', 'C.S. Lee']",Creator,2006.0,mystery,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/?ref_=sr_i_16

They are, but it's not, it's unique in being one of the increasingly few shows that portray relationships between sibling brothers who are straight white men who can and do show they love for each other in the most extreme ways, it brings in an extended cast to help carry the load as time goes on who are likable, some storylines crash and burn , other soar, but there something for everyone to enjoy.It's well made, fans of cinematography will be able to luxuriate in the amazing lighting, direction, the sets are second to non and Canada officers her own take on America's back roads that whilst not authentic, give an atmospheric feel.

It's still remarkably successful, it's even now commanding massive audiences, greater than the first few series even.It's normally transmitted in January, it's cold, wet and after Christmas, a little bit grim. Death in Paradise offers sunshine, fun and murder.We will all have our favourites as to best Detective and favourite cops, but each has had their moments, I've enjoyed them all. We've had some terrific episodes, my favourite story thus far has been 2019's Beyond the Shining Sea, it showed that years after it started it could still shock, entertain and remain hugely relevant, the show has never suffered fatigue or become stale.It comes as no surprise to me that it keeps on going. 8/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1888075/?ref_=sr_i_19

I agree with all previous comments.A clich√©d production in terms of script, direction and visuals. Unrealistic/unbelievable actions by all the principal cast and by the police! :).

Black Mirror,8.7,"['Wunmi Mosaku', 'Monica Dolan', 'Daniel Lapaine', 'Hannah John-Kamen', 'Michaela Coel']",Creator,2011.0,mystery,"I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Bear"", and ""White Christmas."" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format. Overall, I still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=sr_i_21
Imaginary,4.7,"['DeWanda Wise', 'Taegen Burns', 'Pyper Braun', 'Betty Buckley', 'Tom Payne']",Jeff Wadlow,2024.0,mystery,"Pyper Braun merits praise, 'Imaginary' otherwise falls flat.I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's 'The Walking Dead'.The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! üòÇIn conclusion, credit to Braun but everyone else onscreen and off it could've done better in my opinion.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26658104/?ref_=sr_i_22

When the first episode came out I watched it for about 10 mins. and I thought wow and couldn't stop watching. The show I think keeps you involved. Nick has picked some bad shows but not this one. The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened. The show captures a sense of reality and makes the audience more into it. The writers write some pretty decent material. Classic comedy and new moral comedy with good values. All in all I give the show a perfect score of 10/10 stars with both thumbs way up.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=sr_i_24
The Accountant,7.3,"['Ben Affleck', 'Anna Kendrick', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Jon Bernthal', 'Jeffrey Tambor']",Gavin O'Connor,2016.0,mystery,"A thriller should be entertaining and smart, both of which The Accountant is. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is not Christian in the traditional sense, but he is a wolf of a hunter, about as accurate as anyone behind a telescopic gun barrel could be.Yet he's a brilliant accountant at the same time, thank you, autism: He has a savant's grasp of facts and numbers (think Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man) but a serious deficiency in the affective and communicative categories. Affleck plays him with a grasp of disaffection that is almost humorous, in fact is with some of his straight-arrow responses: ""I don't guess,"" he says when queried if he had a hunch about the perpetrator of a fraud.You see, he is hired by all kinds of wealthy and criminal business people and governments to uncook their books or whatever is necessary to discover fraud or put the books in order. These jobs lead to situations where he is wanted by bad guys or the IRS or whomever. Wolff's legitimate, current job for a robotics company is complicated enough for him to need several glass walls to write on (think Affleck's buddy Mark Damon in Good Will Hunting), taking in hours what would consume days for a host of professional accountants. And so it goes according to the thriller formula that the bad guys will be on his trail, and he will be made vulnerable by a cute co-worker, Dana (Anna Kendrick), who has some of his math savvy and maybe a bit of sweet for him. The Accountant veers from formula because that romance is of the ""chaste-and-from-afar"" kind, almost but not quite at the kiss stage. It's pleasant not to be bothered by heavy sex when the complications are of the cerebral, themselves the core of pleasure in this brainy, but not too, action drama.Unfortunately our autistic hero, trained by a merciless military father to defend himself because dad knew son would always be treated as different, slips into thriller stereotype, e.g. Christian puts down too many hired guns at one time, albeit in the service of a noble retaliation for a prison friend. Although the action is within the parameters of the genre, it here feels overdone given the cerebral contexts that otherwise provide plenty of thrills.One of the joys of this film is to see Affleck show some acting chops; he may never be like Dustin Hoffman, but he's memorably stoic here, a long way from J.Lo and Gigli.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140479/?ref_=sr_i_25

There is no story line or investigation into motivations or character just some glib -""yeah I am going to try harder not to murder my patients with racism""Also Grey herself - how many times is this woman going to die?The Terminator would have called it a day by now!I swear she has her own parking space in PurgatoryThe security guards see her coming and just wave her through.""Hey, Meredith, what got you this time?

Anyone But You,6.2,"['Sydney Sweeney', 'Glen Powell', 'Alexandra Shipp', 'Mia Artemis', 'Nat Buchanan']",Will Gluck,2023.0,romance,Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected).

The majority of the reviews and ratings have been great so that only enhanced my excitement. I told myself I'd be happy if it was half as good as the original and I can say that without a doubt that it is. While it's obviously not as good as the original (not much is) it definitely is still a really good show that will no doubt be successful. It has the same Game of Thrones feel with all the action, drama, mystery, etc. People who don't like it either didn't want to because they hate everything or are comparing it to the original...don't. Just take it for what it is and that's a really good show! It was the most watched premiere in HBO history and has already been renewed for another season.

Love Lies Bleeding,7.3,"['Anna Baryshnikov', 'Kristen Stewart', 'Dave Franco', ""Katy O'Brian"", 'Jena Malone']",Rose Glass,2024.0,romance,"My first thought was it feels like the gym was depicted in the way someone who doesn't go to the gym imagines the gym is like. Like they watched Pumping Iron instead of visiting the nearest gym. It's like if Pumping Iron was a raunchy, lesbian, blood-soaked psychedelic experience. With a dash of crime family drama.I found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it's not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it's mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good. It took me a while to realize I recognized Katy O'Brian from The Mandalorian. I loved that she was homeless but still working out; if she can get swole living under a bridge, what's your excuse? Lol.Theres a huge emphasis on smoking and drugs, it's a pretty big theme and mostly referenced on the radio. The story is alright, there's a love, crime and family drama.It's quite raunchy. I wasn't expecting that, but I suppose the movie did give off those vibes. I just didn't watch any trailers or anything and went in blind. It also included some other adult/mature content like domestic violence. It's quite gory as well. Initially, it felt like it was penned by a man; I was surprised to learn it was written/directed by a woman afterward. I recall thinking that there will probably be a lot of people commenting on this, expressing their displeasure with how women are portrayed in movies written by men.The movie had several moments where I thought to myself, well that's taken a weird turn. It gets more weird and weirder the longer in goes. It's really weird that it was common/normal back then to just hit your wife. It was jarring to watch. Franco's character is probably the worst one.It's also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it's just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love. I didn't really find myself rooting for anyone and l didn't feel particularly attached to the movie as a whole. I feel like it could've been better, and by better I mean more psychedelic, more violent, maybe even disturbing. It's not a movie for everyone, but it's pretty interesting and I enjoyed it.

They had more than just ripping each other's clothes off, which is why their relationship endured.I cried, multiple times. I loved this series.

There are so many aspects of the show I like. First, I love how various aspects of the nerds relate to the folks I know (mostly in IT). Second, I love how the show flirts with the stereotypes, such as the dumb blond, but doesn't quite go there. Penny is not dumb, and Raj can be quite social if the circumstances are right.

Lisa Frankenstein,6.1,"['Kathryn Newton', 'Liza Soberano', 'Jenna Davis', 'Trina LaFargue', 'Paola Andino']",Zelda Williams,2024.0,romance,"Lisa Frankenstein is one of those films that I don't like as much as I had hoped I would upon the first viewing, but I like it more and more every time that I see it. In that respect it is similar to Beetlejuice for me personally. A totally campy film with a lot of things that don't make sense or aren't fully explained; it feels like there are some deleted scenes that should have been left in, but maybe they were concerned about the film running too long and kept it short and simple.Kathryn Newton gives an excellent performance as the main character, and her dad reminds me so much of the dad in Coraline.It's simply entertaining dark humor in a teen angst storyline! I totally recommend it for a fun night out.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21188080/?ref_=sr_i_13

Especially a lot about Nica and Rigel's relationship wasn't really portrayed very well on screen and lacked the depth and detail present in the book, which is probably why most people rated this fairly low. I would, too, if I hadn't read the book before. Up until the middle of the movie it was pretty decent and followed the book accurately, but the rest felt incredibly rushed. I really urge people to read the book though, as it's way better than this adaption.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29114029/?ref_=sr_i_15
One Day,7.0,"['Anne Hathaway', 'Jim Sturgess', 'Patricia Clarkson', 'Tom Mison', 'Jodie Whittaker']",Lone Scherfig,2011.0,romance,"Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most clich√© of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Beno√Æt Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clich√©d and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a clich√© situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563738/?ref_=sr_i_16
Someone Like You,6.8,"['Sarah Fisher', 'Jake Allyn', 'Lynn Collins', 'Robyn Lively', 'Bart Johnson']",Tyler Russell,2024.0,romance,"Romance. Christian. Cheesy but sweet! Not for everyone, but if you enjoy Hallmark flicks (and Christian films), you'll probably enjoy this IMHO. Really liked Jake Allyn (as Dawson) He said a lot with his eyes and body language, and he's adorable. I wish the writing, directing and acting were stronger, but it got a little better as it went along. And there were definitely plot holes, especially in regards to HIPAA (releasing health info to others). This is adapted from a Karen Kingsbury book (Christian author) and this is the first of her books that she produced under her own production company. I think the director/co-writer, and some other people that contributed to the film, are related to Mrs. Kingsbury as well. Definitely wouldn't give it a 9 or 10, but it doesn't deserve a 1 or 2 either IMHO!

Also, when he's writing his script about his parents, the type says, ""INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE, 1987""Andrew Scott is 47.

Killers of the Flower Moon,7.6,"['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Robert De Niro', 'Lily Gladstone', 'Jesse Plemons', 'Tantoo Cardinal']",Martin Scorsese,2023.0,romance,"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/?ref_=sr_i_19
Irish Wish,5.2,"['Lindsay Lohan', 'Ed Speleers', 'Alexander Vlahos', 'Ayesha Curry', 'Elizabeth Tan']",Janeen Damian,2024.0,romance,"I am not going to be over-critical with my review. This movie isn't meant to be anything more than what it is, just a romantic comedy with beautiful scenery. If you are expecting more than that, I suggest you don't bother. The storyline is quaint and predictable. But it was an okay way to spend an hour and a half, even if you were just envious of the backdrop during that time. It is good to see Lindsay Lohan in this rom/com. She is good in the role of her character who can't quite speak up for herself and quite frankly is a bit of a doormat when it comes to her crush Paul Kennedy. But as they say, the grass isn't greener on the other side, it just appears that way. And through a wish to Saint Bridget chaos ensues.If you just want to put something on and tune out for a while, then give it a go.

I took a hiatus from K-drama because I don't feel what I felt during those dramas way back in the 2000s. Maybe because there's no spoiler back then. Anyway, as a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, he never repeats a role. At first, I got bored with his comeback drama, but after watching the first episode, I started to love his role as a husband. I also started to love Kim Ji-won as an actress. I hated her during The Heirs. üòÜ I could say that both of them have come so far. Going back to the drama, the story is not the typical love story. It's more about the feelings after marriage. As a married woman who had a failed marriage, you can feel the love between the couple that was hidden because of emotional exhaustion. After watching the four episodes, I started to understand the main characters and I couldn't wait for the next episodes, especially for the lesson learned about marriage.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27668559/?ref_=sr_i_21
"New York, I Love You",6.2,"['Shia LaBeouf', 'Natalie Portman', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Hayden Christensen', 'Andy Garcia']",Directors,2008.0,romance,"The second installment in the I LOVE YOU series appears at first to be a mere variety-pack of sad-funny vignettes but occasionally it veers into territory explored by such other recent films as Paul Haggis's CRASH or Michael Hanecke's CODE INCONNU, wherein disparate inhabitants of a large city cross paths, not only affecting each other's lives in unexpected ways, but feeding into a larger overall story. Most of these New York City stories manage to wrap up with a twist. This O. Henry-style surprise element is the structural key that gives several segments their sense of closure, especially in Yvan Attal's two-part entry about encounters between smokers outside a restaurant. In one encounter, Ethan Hawke as a fast-talking young writer brazenly tries to pick up a woman (Maggie Q) with unexpected results; in the other, Chris Cooper and Robin Wright Penn share some tantalizing conversation with an equally unexpected resolution. Almost as good are a strange prom date between an awkward boy (Anton Yelchin) and the wheelchair-bound daughter (Olivia Thirlby) of an eccentric, pushy pharmacist (James Caan) and a slick bit wherein Hayden Christensen as a smart alecky pickpocket goes up against Andy Garcia as a college professor who turns the tables on him in the manner of Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall in the 1932 classic TROUBLE IN PARADISE. Standing apart from all other segments is the lovely character study of a married couple (Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman) bickering gently as they walk to the seashore to commemorate their 63rd wedding anniversary ‚Äì beautiful acting by two old masters. In Allen Hughes's segment there is some excellent internal monologue writing by Alexandra Cassavetes and Stephen Winter about two insecure people on their way to their second date with each other, wonderfully enacted by Drea De Matteo and Bradley Cooper. Other segments - including Mira Nair's with Natalie Portman as a Hassidic Jew momentarily smitten with a Jain diamond merchant (Irrfan Khan) on the eve of her wedding, and Shekhar Kapur's with Julie Christie as an aging singer who checks into an ethereal hotel staffed by a crippled Shia LeBouef and a haggard John Hurt ‚Äì have their moments, but peter off into nowhere. Too bad the reunion of Christie and Hurt almost exactly 40 years after their only other co-starring film, IN SEARCH OF GREGORY, couldn't at least have shown them together clearly, from the front, in the same frame, just once.Other than one episode in Brighton Beach and one in Chinatown, the action takes place in well-heeled sections of Manhattan. The black and Puerto-Rican population is barely represented, though the age range of subjects covers about 7 through about 90. The boroughs of the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island are ignored completely. Few of the stories concern themselves with themes or situations unique to New York. Most of them could just as easily take place in London or Berlin or Buenos Aires or Tokyo. But the rapidly shifting focus, the large and interesting cast and occasional sharp writing, keep one reasonably entertained despite the occasional misfires.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808399/?ref_=sr_i_22

Sex Education,8.3,"['Asa Butterfield', 'Gillian Anderson', 'Ncuti Gatwa', 'Emma Mackey', 'Connor Swindells']",Creator,2019.0,romance,"**Review of ""Sex Education"" Season 4**I recently finished watching the fourth season of ""Sex Education,"" and I must admit that I'm quite disappointed with the direction the series has taken. The first three seasons were a delightful blend of humor, heartfelt storytelling, and character development, but this season left me feeling like it missed the mark.One of the major issues I encountered was the lack of a cohesive and engaging storyline. In previous seasons, the plotlines were well-crafted and kept me eagerly anticipating what would happen next. However, in season 4, it felt like the story was all over the place, lacking a clear and satisfying narrative arc.The introduction of new characters also left much to be desired. Unlike the well-developed characters we've come to love, the new additions felt shallow and lacked depth. It seemed like they were introduced merely for the sake of expanding the cast rather than contributing meaningfully to the story. The focus on side cast was way too much that it annoyed me...They should have just given more screen time to main cast for which we have been waiting...Moreover, I couldn't help but notice that this season appeared to prioritize the promotion of LGBTQ+ themes at the expense of other essential storylines. While it's important to address such topics sensitively, it felt like an overload, overshadowing the other compelling aspects that made the show great.My biggest disappointment, however, was the lack of closure for several key storylines. What about Otis, Ruby, or Maeve? It felt like their character arcs were left hanging without any resolution. Maeve's character, in particular, seemed to regress to where she started in the beginning of the season, which left me feeling unsatisfied.In light of these issues, I can't help but give ""Sex Education"" Season 4 a rating of 4 out of 10. It's a disappointing and, at times, boring conclusion to a series that had so much potential. It's disheartening to witness the decline of what was once a very promising and enjoyable show.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7767422/?ref_=sr_i_26

I'm not saying it's my favorite show or even close to that but it's one of the most surprising shows I've seen.

Sex and the City,7.3,"['Sarah Jessica Parker', 'Kim Cattrall', 'Kristin Davis', 'Cynthia Nixon', 'David Eigenberg']",Creator,1998.0,romance,"I first caught SATC in the late nineties, and thought it was great. At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.First, I eventually read the book. Despite the author's reluctance to say anything, the show never was much like the book, and has - over the years - strayed far far away. The book is, like most of Candace Bushnell's work, insightful and witty, with its humor derived from a certain urbane severity; it shares more with the works of Carrie Fischer and Tama Janowitz than any of the stuff now labeled Chick Lit.Bushnell's characters may fall in love, even marry. They may have Manolos and Birkin bags, but this is all background noise of sorts. Bushnell is an under-rated pop-anthropologist, depicting the tribes that inhabit the big city. We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.Second, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair. The movie underlines this - while there are great story lines, etc, the theatrical release is one obscene orgy of consumerism and decadence.Too bad. The last years of SATC is an insult to both the book and the early years of the show. It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159206/?ref_=sr_i_28

Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

Josh Radnor also does a very good job in his first leading role.I agree that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but I think this show has a lot of elements that make a good series: good plot, good writing, good acting, and attractive cast). I think previous series like ""Friends"" have raised the bar very high for new sitcoms, but I hope that even if a series isn't destined to become the next ""Friends,"" it can still be recognized as a good and worthwhile sitcom.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/?ref_=sr_i_31
Two and a Half Men,7.1,"['Jon Cryer', 'Ashton Kutcher', 'Angus T. Jones', 'Conchata Ferrell', 'Charlie Sheen']",Creators,2003.0,romance,"Two and a Half Men was my all-time favorite TV show. I watched every episode when it aired from the series premiere up until Charlie's exit. Now, I see it time to time, and I couldn't be more disappointed with Chuck Lorre and his crew. Nothing against Ashton Kutcher, he's trying his best to be funny, but he and Jon Cryer don't have the amazing chemistry that Sheen and Cryer did. To pile on, Jake (Angus T. Jones) has now left the show, replaced by Charlie's 25-year old lesbian daughter, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn).I'll admit that I do still watch the show occasionally, not because I enjoy it, but more out of curiosity to see how bad it can really get. In my opinion, if the writers had done it right (assuming that firing Sheen was right, which it absolutely was not), after Charlie's death, they should have bumped Cryer up to lead actor, with Jones beside him, and added a young boy to the cast, carrying the title Two and a Half Men. Now it's Two Men, a Lesbian and a Housekeeper.The plot is getting more and more far-fetched and unbelievable. That, and the jokes are nothing new. Alan, get out of my Malibu beach house. Bring home a woman and sleep with her. Blah blah blah, what used to be funny is not funny the hundredth time. With or without Charlie Sheen, this show is years past its prime, and needs to be done.

PLUS the fact one was ""Ryan Gosling"" body and the other was overweight threw me that they were twins. Both played on stereotypes which I Loved they made us look into ourselves a little.So where does the show go from here? It has a great premise. Dual time lines. You can do a lot with that. Have stories play out with flashbacks to tell a larger story (ala Lost). The casting was nailed with exceptional talent. I was interested in every character. They even nailed it by casting Simon and Simon vet Gerald McRaney. He was the glue that MADE that story line click. He speech on the chair was Emmy worthy. I hope he is a regular cast member and explore his wife's death and the death of his one child.I'm hooked for at least season one. No need for twists. The dual time lines and great characters is enough for me. They can bounce all around in the 80s when the ""triplets"" are 4 or 10 or 15. triple time lines or more. Milo and Mandy can be made to look older and cast kids to play the parts at different ages. So much room to explore. I predict a good 4-7 year run.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5555260/?ref_=sr_i_33
Station 19,7.0,"['Jaina Lee Ortiz', 'Jason George', 'Barrett Doss', 'Jay Hayden', 'Danielle Savre']",Creator,2018.0,romance,Shows relationships between firefighters and every day life situations and the diversity of people and conflict resolution. The situations they get into. One of the most entertaining shows I have watched. It has both awesome and heartbreaking moments that firefighters face in the line of duty and managing their lives at home as well. Love that they included Greys Anatomy with their mashups including characters between the two shows. If you love that show this is definitely a must watch! Sad that this will be the last season unfortunately as I seen an article saying that they will be able to make a good ending for the show for the last season.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7053188/?ref_=sr_i_34
Past Lives,7.9,"['Greta Lee', 'Teo Yoo', 'John Magaro', 'Moon Seung-ah', 'Leem Seung-min']",Celine Song,2023.0,romance,"Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13238346/?ref_=sr_i_35
No Hard Feelings,6.4,"['Jennifer Lawrence', 'Andrew Barth Feldman', 'Laura Benanti', 'Matthew Broderick', 'Natalie Morales']",Gene Stupnitsky,2023.0,romance,"This movie definitely met me and my friend group's expectations for comedy, our whole theater practically laughed out loud every few minutes. Jennifer's comedic timing is something I hope we get to see more of on the big screen. An amazing actor as always. The tonal shift to a more serious story in the last half might catch some off guard, but I think it added some realism and depth to the plot. More than that though, the best comedies still have a message and core of serious as light it may be with that shiny happy ending. I really enjoyed this movie and had fun in a theater for the first time in a while.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15671028/?ref_=sr_i_36

It's a nice escape from my every day life but I sometimes am bothered by all the very unrealistic events and characters. All the characters for example, have an incredibly high tolerance for remixing, reworking and rehashing the drama in their own lives. There were times when I felt fed up with all the new characters and the drama which created disjointed mess but there still are high points within the seasons. I miss Jenny and Vanessa as characters, especially Jenny who was one of the most down to earth characters. I love how things go with Chuck Bass and Blair but somehow I have the feeling that the character of Dan is missing the point. I'm not sure if it's the actor who's playing him or the screenwriters who slowly but very certainly 'kill' Dan's personality. And of course, there's Nate whose existence on the show I still can't figure out. All the critics aside, like I said in the beginning, it's a really enjoyable show which does its job - it entertains us.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/?ref_=sr_i_37
ER,7.9,"['Anthony Edwards', 'George Clooney', 'Julianna Margulies', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Noah Wyle']",Creator,1994.0,romance,"Alongside The Simpsons, ER is one of the longest running US TV shows and through its successful blend of wonderful and memorable characters, intriguing story lines, strong intensity involving the cast and impressive action sequences, this medical drama is by far streets ahead of the likes of Chicago Hope and even Grey's Anatomy. Unfortunately in recent years, ER has declined in quality due to the departure of key characters, poor story lines and dull ideas, of which accounted for the decrease in viewing figures. The current crop of characters Neela, Luka, Abby, Pratt, Taggart and Barnett don't hold a candle to the experienced old rear guard of Greene, Carter, Benton, Lewis, Hathaway and Ross. They, in particular, were the original, and arguably the best set of characters the show has had.The earlier seasons of ER were great- those times were witty, exciting and a joy to behold for us viewers. Such a shame however that when the old characters had left- or in the case of Mark Greene passed away- the writers of this drama were unable to fill that void with their newer, replacement characters, as well as good story lines and as such, the programme has suffered as a result. There were a few story lines I didn't agree with; likewise for example, Mark Greene and Elizabeth Corday getting married together as a couple. I always had an inkling for Mark and Susan, of whom I felt had a lot more in common with each other and considering the history they had together as close friends and work colleagues they had a bond and chemistry that was like a match made in heaven. Also, a lot of ER fans preferred Mark to be with Susan, compared to those who liked Mark and Elizabeth. And so its such a shame that we never got to see Mark and Susan as a couple. There were also tragic and memorable story lines which are worth mentioning also that touched viewers hearts- Mark's brain tumour and his evitable death, Benton's son being mentally handicapped, Weaver coming to terms with her sexuality and coming out as a lesbian to her friends, work colleagues and family, and the consummation of Luka and Abbey and Ross and Carol's relationships. The main problem with the ER though were the main characters of the earlier seasons who were on the show for a few series, and then suddenly they are written off. It doesn't matter how many new ideas, characters you introduce to the show because it is the original ideas, characters and realism of the show, of which worked so well in the first place that should be further developed. I wouldn't say that ER has jumped the shark, but it is certainly no longer the same show as it was back in 1994. ER is currently in its 14th season and whilst it is somewhat of an impressive feat, many of the original cast have gone and yet it can be argued that in reference to the current season the show has gradually become boring and stale, the longer it has gone on. As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end- and ER perhaps is no exception. Perhaps now it is the time to lay this ghost to rest. As much as it is arguably the best and most successful medical drama in TV history, ER during the last few years has spiralled downhill; the writing isn't as good as it was and it has lost a lot of its spark, which made it the no#1 hit US drama around. Still, as mentioned earlier, it is still the best medical/hospital drama to ever grace our screens. As not even the classic St Elsewhere and Chicago Hope comes close to matching, rivalling or surpassing ER's accomplishments. Besides, this show will live long in TV history that's for sure and quite rightly so.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/?ref_=sr_i_38
Castle,8.1,"['Nathan Fillion', 'Stana Katic', 'Susan Sullivan', 'Jon Huertas', 'Seamus Dever']",Creator,2009.0,romance,"The pilot episode for ABC's new crime show ""Castle"" left me wanting more, much more in fact, and that is exactly what a good pilot should do. The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.I'll start with Nathan Fillion(of ""Firefly"" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is ""72%"" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in ""Firefly""(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).Then there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a clich√© tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).What it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.Before I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature. Done.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219024/?ref_=sr_i_39
The Voyeurs,6.1,"['Sydney Sweeney', 'Justice Smith', 'Ben Hardy', 'Natasha Liu Bordizzo', 'Katharine King So']",Michael Mohan,2021.0,romance,"Overall the movie was enjoyable. Production and cinematography looked great. All 4 leads did a very good job. The main couple was likable & believable and the 2nd couple were attractive enough that you could imagine people would be checking them out.I also like the 'Eye' theme throughout. From the sublime opening credits, song choices, Pippa's job, to the scene when Pippa and Seb first meet we get a very artsy shot of just her eye, then his. It was all very well done.There were a few things that occurred that I didn't see coming and I was very curious to see how it would play out. Also no spoilers, but I did actually like what I thought was going to be the main ending at the gallery. But then we got another 5-10 minute twist ending and that, IMO, let the film down a little bit. Sometimes less is more.But overall a recommend.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/?ref_=sr_i_40
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,8.3,"['Sarah Michelle Gellar', 'Nicholas Brendon', 'Alyson Hannigan', 'Anthony Head', 'James Marsters']",Creator,1997.0,romance,"Buffy is series that was not only consistently good, but a series that grew better over time. The first season is good, but not fantastic. It was shorter because the WB was not sure if they would have a viewing base and only had 12 episodes. The second season developed the characters and you began to see the magic of the show. As the series progresses, I am astounded by the writing, directing, and acting. Joss Whedon is a genius of the camera and master of the pen, and anyone who argues with me is fooling themselves. The cast, as well as the characters, matures over time and become living, breathing people that you believe.In short, if you are considering watching this show, I highly recommend you watch all of the first and second season before making any judgements. Frankly, this is my favorite story of all time. It transcends the TV, and beats out most books, movies, and other TV shows. This show is beautiful.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/?ref_=sr_i_41
Downton Abbey,8.7,"['Hugh Bonneville', 'Phyllis Logan', 'Elizabeth McGovern', 'Brendan Coyle', 'Laura Carmichael']",Julian Fellowes,2010.0,romance,"DOWNTON ABBEY is the kind of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" material that the British do with such finesse that one can only sit back and marvel at the sets, costumes, music, and above all, the performances that are all on an extraordinarily high level.The moment the first series ended, I wanted to see more--so no doubt I'll be ordering my copy of Season 2. Central among the gifted performers are Maggie Smith (as the Dowager Countess Violet), Hugh Bonneville as the Earl of Grantham, and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, his American wife. But all of the lesser roles are played to perfection with special mention for Brendan Coyle as John Bates, Joanne Froggatt as Ana, Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael.Complicit in schemes involving wicked behavior are two of the downstairs help played brilliantly by Siobhan Finneran and Rob-James Collier as Thomas, both of whom cast a shadow over the household.The plot has dialog that is always witty and good for a quick chuckle or a gasp of disapproval and the character motivations are all played out in a convincing manner true to each person involved.Very compelling to view the fluid story unfold with its many sub-plots and shadings of the class warfare that existed in the U.K. then and now.Absolutely one of the most rewarding and richly satisfying shows from Great Britain that have come along in recent years. The color photography amid location settings create the proper atmosphere for the entire story which takes place just before WWI among a wealthy titled household undergoing some major changes inside the castle walls.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/?ref_=sr_i_42
Love,6.1,"['Aomi Muyock', 'Karl Glusman', 'Klara Kristin', 'Juan Saavedra', 'Ugo Fox']",Gaspar No√©,2015.0,romance,"... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director ""falls in love"" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie.

This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story.

I guess I expected more focus on the humans (again) and less on the Titans (again)...but this? This was not that. Yeah they had humans, but they were mostly more of a footnote in the story, which could have been almost completely told without the humans, but they did add a little flavour to the mix. Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me.

This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind.

Dune: Part One,8.0,"['Timoth√©e Chalamet', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Zendaya', 'Oscar Isaac', 'Jason Momoa']",Denis Villeneuve,2021.0,sci-fi,"This movie is big. It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.This is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.I would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.However, this is only ""Part 1"", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_=sr_i_7

It had so many funny lines, shocking twists, interesting plot lines revealed and everything even in just the first episode! Plus the effects are nothing to sneeze at. What I've seen so far has shown the perfect balance of dark comedy, drama, and a wonderfully oddball sci-fi, all packaged into a small town setting, which is something I've always liked. So, great acting, great scripting, great filming, I was hooked from the first few seconds and would recommend.

The games have shifted and evolved with time, but I'm surprised at how many other commentators claim the series isn't dark enough or too funny. All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game. The weird macguffin story setting the vault dwelling protagonist out on a quest to the surface (a quest she really doesn't understand the context for) is also totally fallout.So it works.

Not sure what changed behind the scenes, but it was a good thing, whatever happened.I watched season one because of the effects, which were pretty great! Now, I'm watching because of the story too, which is pretty good! I used to watch the old school Doctor Who because of the story, not the effects budget, which was probably about $150.

X-Men '97,9.0,"['Lenore Zann', 'Matthew Waterson', 'Cal Dodd', 'A.J. LoCascio', 'George Buza']",Creators,2024.0,sci-fi,"This is the impression I got from just two episodes. This series deals with classic X-Men themes like prejudice, discrimination, hate, injustice, fear, and bigotry against mutants by humans again, but I felt like they were doing it in a more mature and improved way. I also gladly notice they didn't make a Wolverine show, and every mutant character is getting equal screen time and development, especially Cyclops getting what he deserves and shining as team leader. It's also welcome to see characters like Bishop and Morph join the X team. I liked Magneto's acceptance of Xaviers's human and mutant coexistence agenda and his decision to become a new leader of the X team because that made him a more three-dimensional and ambigious character rather than a one-note villain. This sequel is also very loyal and respectful to the old series and the nostalgic feelings of X-men fans. They are using the same character models, voiceovers, opening intro, closing outro, and music with improved and modernized animation. They didn't use the same opening stock footage intro from the first episode for the second episode's opening intro, adding new characters like Magneto and scenes to it, so obviously there is no laziness in this show. Overall, I got a very good impression from this reboot and sequel, and I'm looking forward to watching new episodes.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16026746/?ref_=sr_i_12
American Horror Story,8.0,"['Lady Gaga', 'Kathy Bates', 'Angela Bassett', 'Sarah Paulson', 'Evan Peters']",Creators,2011.0,sci-fi,"I used to be such a huge fan of the show, and in my opinion seasons 7 and 8 were its pinnacles. I re-watched them several times because they are pure masterpieces. Then, Season 9 came around, and I was so disappointed and couldn't stop questioning whether it was made by the same people who had created all the previous seasons. In season 10, things got even worse. While the first part of the season seemed promising, its finale turned out to be so underwhelming that I felt really let down. Being so disenchanted by it, I couldn't pass even the first episode of the second installment, which, in general, appeared super unappealing. Moving on to this last season, the first episode of Season 11 is such a bummer that I'm not going to continue watching this show anymore. That's enough! It's official, AHS is dead. I was asking myself the whole time while watching that ridiculous episode what it even had to do with AHS. Where is a horror in this story? Where are all the great characters? I understand why all the lead actors from pervious seasons decided to distant themselves from the show. From now on, I will do the same.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624/?ref_=sr_i_13

Lost is one of my favorite shows ever and the reviews for this have been mostly positive so I figured I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. I was hooked from the first episode to the last. I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still. That's probably the only negative thing I have say about his show, that it didn't offer enough answers in the first season.

As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made.

The story was beyond imagination, really epic, and it's not about one single country or one single culture, you can see every nation, every race united together when facing danger. The TV series tried to make everything the same as the book. One star was deducted because the pacing of story telling, all the flashbacks and neon lights scenes are a bit annoying and confusing, when not everyone knows the background of the story.

Glass,6.6,"['James McAvoy', 'Bruce Willis', 'Samuel L. Jackson', 'Anya Taylor-Joy', 'Sarah Paulson']",M. Night Shyamalan,2019.0,sci-fi,"This is a thinking person's movie. It's largely dialogue heavy and not afraid to take its time. It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.Director Shyamalan doesn't get much respect from the critics, but screw the critics, he did brilliantly here from writing to directing.And James McAvoy deserves every acting award for 2019. Might as well just give him all of them now, best actor, best actress, best child actor, etc., all of them, because no one's topping this performance.And about the action, I saw director Shyamalan talking in an interview about how he's mainly interested in drama and that action is not his strong point, but he was really downplaying his handling of the action, because the fight scenes here are legitimately awesome. Glass thankfully features none of the shaky rapid-editing style that plagues so many other action movies. It is all well shot, so you'll have no trouble following the action. We even see lots of unusually artistic camera shots during the action, such as showing long close up shots of people's faces while they're in the middle of fighting. My favorite was a long held shot from the point of view of being inside a van while we're seeing a fight happening outside, as the combatants are circling around and slamming into the van. That was just plain cool, the kind of shot that's just mind-boggling to think about how they managed to pull it off.And don't trust the rotten critics. Just don't. They're so worthless, those critics. They're wrong about almost every movie these days.

Madame Web,3.8,"['Dakota Johnson', 'Sydney Sweeney', 'Isabela Merced', ""Celeste O'Connor"", 'Tahar Rahim']",S.J. Clarkson,2024.0,sci-fi,"Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11057302/?ref_=sr_i_22

Dune,6.3,"['Kyle MacLachlan', 'Virginia Madsen', 'Francesca Annis', 'Leonardo Cimino', 'Brad Dourif']",David Lynch,1984.0,sci-fi,"Say what you will about incoherence, this is more sensuous than any Star Wars. In fact, it is the most expensive 'tripping' ever produced in film - though far from the most satisfying.It helps to know the book and forget it as you watch this. Not being familiar with the book, you're left with a disjointed tapestry of weird costumes and special effects, some of them impressive, but if you are, and don't have to burden yourself with following the constantly clumsy explanation of the multifaceted Dune universe, you can enjoy this as illustration of a few core ideas.Herbert's novel was the product of strange and powerful times. The US public was experiencing the Civil Rights upheaval, its short-lived infatuation with Islam and meditation, and the same year as the book came out, LSD had spilled out of some top-secret government labs into the streets and youth culture of San Francisco. The first satellite images of Earth had just been published. The Black Panthers had entered the vernacular.So all the stuff about prescient visions, mentats and mastering mind, (herbally) expanded consciousness as the tool to the navigation and 'folding' of space, Herbert wrote with one eye on the Jordan Belson, Beatles and Maharishi crowd - the generation between film noir and Lucas that for a brief time projected truths into constructed cosmologies.Herbert was more erudite than most. But he was caught under the same spell - the expectation of a noble jihad of the people and wise lamas from the East coming to teach 'the way'. And you can tell that he was exposed to Eastern thought through Jungians, by his laboriously constructed mythology and (now trite) focus on a Chosen One's journey.Lynch was a late bloomer in that scene. To my knowledge, he fell in with what was being marketed as 'transcendental meditation' in his AFI years, while filming Eraserhead. I don't know what they practice behind closed doors - my interest lies with the Chinese model and they seem cultish to me. But, there's no doubt to me that he passed on the Lucas gig, thinking he was going to work on a vision of some power.The film outright fails because the scope of the book is too big (to think that Hobbit is being stretched into a trilogy these days), and because he lacked the right collaborators and probably the predisposition to make an 'action' Dune.Now Jodorowsky's Dune would have been something to see, probably as cumbersome about spirituality but much more organic. But, it's worth noting a few interesting things about this, in context of how Lynch would expand in later years.He zeroes in on the transcendental experience of 'awakening the sleeper'. He does so in an obvious manner. Rambaldi's spiceworms as blossoming desert flowers top his visual meditation. And that all of Herbert's pomp and mythological noise work against him submerging the idea.Keep in mind the Chinese notion - from the Tao Te Ching - that the 'soft beats the hard', stressed twice in the film even though no one actually thinks or fights in the Chinese way. Discard everything that is hard, from the crass Harkonnen to the acting style (mentat Dourif!) to the sophomoric rousing of Fremen rebellion, laser battles and final redemption.The one part that is soft is at House Atreides, the preparation for Dune. What is there? Familiar dynamics - it's soap opera if you discard the costumes. Premonitions of murder and telepathic wiring with a fabric behind reason. A woman with her box of illusory sensations. A space flight through the doors of perception.It's heady. None of it really works, because Herbert's synchretic universe is not one of internal martial arts, what we see matters. But does any of it remind you of a David Lynch film you know?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=sr_i_27

It was quite the experience. Godzilla was truly an unstoppable force in this movie, whenever Godzilla would show up it was hard to feel anything but futility.

Doctor Who,8.6,"['Jodie Whittaker', 'Peter Capaldi', 'Pearl Mackie', 'Matt Smith', 'David Tennant']",Sydney Newman,2005.0,sci-fi,"It seems that there is a huge diversity in the reaction to this show. Fortunately for the IL' Doc, I think this means he will be around for awhile again. I have seen ""Rose,"" The first episode in the revamped BBC series, and I have to say I am thrilled. The majority of the negative reviews seem to be coming from ultra-die hard Whovians. I myself was a giant DR.Who nerd in my younger years. I had a subscription to Dr.Who magazine, I sent Tom Baker a letter when I was 10 years old, (I still have the autograph he sent me back, thank you Tom!)My grandmother knitted me an eight foot long scarf etc..etc..I could tell you who Roger Delgado is and why when he looked like Geoffery Beevers he really wanted to go on Holiday to Traken.In early 1984 when I was 8 years old, I met the Doctor and his friends Sarah and Harry. It was at midnight in Arizona on a black in white television that was barely 10 inches wide. I was transported to somewhere I had never been and have never been since. It was like Peter Pan taking you to Neverland. Anyone who met Doctor Who at such an early age will agree with me that the magic was that vivid and so real that you felt you were right there side by side with those characters.As I grew up, I grew out of it. Real life takes a hold, and while Perpugilliam Brown was amazing to stare at, it became a lot more important to go talk to a girl in person on a Saturday night than stay home by the time 16 years old came around. A passing interest in Sylv and Sophie was there, but ultimately, Puff the magic dragon let out a mighty roar because this Jackie Paper had grown up.Having said that, I watched ""Rose"" with two hats. The former obsessive fan with the critical eye, and the adult who wanted to be whisked away by Pan again.I feel the show succeeds in the latter department. I had a huge smile on my face the entire 45 minutes, and if I had to guess, this show is going to capture the fancy of a lot of young ones, and even though Doctor Who was always my best friend, I'm ready to share him with the people who he was made for in the first place.

Black Mirror,8.7,"['Wunmi Mosaku', 'Monica Dolan', 'Daniel Lapaine', 'Hannah John-Kamen', 'Michaela Coel']",Creator,2011.0,sci-fi,"I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Bear"", and ""White Christmas."" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format.

Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable.

It seems cliche to say a film is dreamlike but there is no other way to describe Spaceman. Imagine watching an entire movie through a Kaleidoscope. Not just through the lens of said scope, but also the lens of childlike wonder.This is a heavy film that asks a lot of the audience. Anyone who sticks with it the whole way will be rewarded with a nice story of friendship and hope.

The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, ""This isn't very scary..."", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the ""Mulder and Scully in love"" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns. Because I got to be there for the ride...and though it was often bumpy and is now coming to its end...I can look back and say, ""Hey, it was a GREAT 9 years.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/?ref_=sr_i_37

But overall they did a great job and Bill Nighy Really helps the move.There is not much to say about the plot, because it's basedthat based on a true story. But what I miss was more background story of each character.I choose to give the movie at 7, and I can't see where I could be better to get a higher score. Not ever move I can get a 10 just because there are no room for improvement, and this is one of them.

The Iron Claw,7.7,"['Zac Efron', 'Jeremy Allen White', 'Harris Dickinson', 'Maura Tierney', 'Holt McCallany']",Sean Durkin,2023.0,sport,"The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21064584/?ref_=sr_i_3
Ted Lasso,8.8,"['Jason Sudeikis', 'Hannah Waddingham', 'Jeremy Swift', 'Phil Dunster', 'Brett Goldstein']",Creators,2020.0,sport,"The premise is almost maddeningly stupid and cliche, but the performances, tone, and writing are so pitch perfect (yes, I know) that this one appears to be a resounding win. Sudeikis is so inoffensively handsome and manly, when he slaps on Ted Lasso's indefatigable smile and positive outlook he has even the viewer, who knows this is a complete work of fiction, believing in him. Hannah Waddingham's Rebecca smoulders in every scene, an absolute smoke show so hot it nearly hurts the eyes to look at her though you could not pay me to look away. With an interesting gallery of supporting acts orbiting Ted, he shines brilliantly and draws them all in, albeit quite reluctantly. I was one of the cold hearts Ted Lasso won over: his charm and love for the most simple joys (including wordplay) make his presence irresistible. The first three episodes serve as the most deft first touch, I wait with bated breath to see the spectacular finish.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/?ref_=sr_i_4
The Boys in the Boat,6.9,"['Joel Edgerton', 'Callum Turner', 'Peter Guinness', 'Sam Strike', 'Thomas Elms']",George Clooney,2023.0,sport,"Clooney hits the mark beautifully with this film. This is a story about a ragtag group of boys who come together to unify a nation despite the circumstances around it. A story that hard work will beat talent when talent fails to work hard. This movie didn't have the marketing of Aquaman or Wonka but the story is compelling and well told. Edgerton is great, as is the rest of cast. This movie will get you on your feet and make you feel proud to be an American (if you are one). To me, this movie illustrates, similar to Miracle, Remember the Titans or Rocky (albeit fictional) that nothing is more culturally significant to Americans than sports.

It's weird to see an earnest version of a Dances With Wolves style narrative in 2023 and like previous Taika films, undercuts some of the emotional beats for humour. Luckily, the heart of the film still manages to shine through it all.Michael Fassbender proves he's a really talented comedic actor purely because he plays everything completely straight, which works wonders for all the comedy. Oscar Kightley is the MVP though, that endless optimism wins you over instantly and the film wisely knows to keep him around for as much as possible.Taika Waititi's direction is so recognisably him, mostly for the better. Even though too many emotional moments are undercut, the jokes themselves are consistently funny. Starting from the first scene the jokes are landing and they rarely miss. Whilst the final match isn't the most thrilling, Taika does successfully draw out the result as much as possible for maximum impact.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10767052/?ref_=sr_i_7
Happy Gilmore,7.0,"['Adam Sandler', 'Christopher McDonald', 'Julie Bowen', 'Frances Bay', 'Carl Weathers']",Dennis Dugan,1996.0,sport,"In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore¬Ö I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film.
There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here, as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green, and for the most part, this comedy scheme works pretty well here. Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression, clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. Indeed, some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go (`PIECE!! OF!! MONKEY *beep*!!'). So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things, but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face. Luckily for the movie and for its fans, this is not the most important element of a movie like this. It's not very likely that a slob like Happy, who doesn't make the hockey team, is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right, and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back. You would think that, having seen that he can make that much money, he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house. A noble cause, obviously, but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent. But who cares? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections. Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary, and there is clearly some overdone product placement, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film. Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film (although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2, when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing), and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified (although just barely) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts (or lack thereof) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing. As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments, Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are. They want fame and recognition, he wants money and beer (and Virginia, the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film).
There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that, as much as I personally enjoy the movie, simply fall flat (many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie, or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament, or anything involving Chubbs' prosthetic hand) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to. Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character, despite all of his destructive habits, and the film is peppered with other notable performances, not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs, the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore, and Christopher MacDonald, in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin. Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler, which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here, so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected. Sandler does not make award-winning films, and chances are he never will, but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable. It is, to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up, a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema. It's a lot of fun, but there's no nutritional value.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116483/?ref_=sr_i_8
Ferrari,6.5,"['Adam Driver', 'Shailene Woodley', 'Giuseppe Festinese', 'Alessandro Cremona', 'Derek Hill']",Michael Mann,2023.0,sport,"Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3758542/?ref_=sr_i_9
One Tree Hill,7.8,"['Chad Michael Murray', 'James Lafferty', 'Hilarie Burton', 'Bethany Joy Lenz', 'Sophia Bush']",Creator,2003.0,sport,"One Tree Hill is Warner Brothers latest effort to emulate the success of its popular 90's teenage show Dawsons Creek and it a very good job overall. This show really will appeal to the teenage audience, and young adults and it is very plot driven to this age range. The show deals with a lot of sensitive issues that teenagers face such as: sex, drugs,marriage, adoption, affairs, conflicts etc.The show is set in the fictional town of One Tree Hill and it stars: Chad Michael Murray as honest, likable Lucas Scott, James Laferty as spoilt rich child Nathan Scott, Hillarie Burton as the lonely but good hearted Peyton and Sophia Bush as the feisty but popular Brooke. The actors and actresses cast in these young roles really are the eye candy of the show. They all put in good performances and are totally believable in their roles.Backing up the cast are a set of adult actors and actresses and these really add another depth to the show. Paul Johansson (Dan Scott) and Moira Kelly (Karen Scott) deserve mentions as they put in great performances as the respective struggling single mother and evil father of the boys. Craig Sheffer (Keith Scott) does a strong performance as Lucas step father and Dan Scotts bother, Barbara Alyn Woods (Deb Scott) makes a good long suffering wife and mother to Dan and Nathan look believable and Barry Cobin does a sturdy performance as Coach Whitey. The adult actors really shine in this show and they help to make the characters interact as well as the children on the show.Underneath the shows skin is the running pulse of the conflict between long-lost brothers Nathan and Lucas Scott and that is what the whole show is built on. This show works so well is because it allows the adults as much air time as the teenagers and this lets the viewers care much more about all the characters, not just the teenage ones.The characters are nearly all beautiful, teenage girls will droll over the eye candy of Lucas and Nathan and the teenage boys will droll over Brooke and Peyton. But the fact is that these characters are all very well written and it means that the audience identifies and likes each of the characters in their own unique way. They are certainly not two dimensional characters and as the actors and actresses can act means they are believable. One Tree Hill is one of the most underrated shows on Television, and this is due to the fact that most people dismiss this show at first hand because they compare it with other teenage shows such as The OC and thats not really fair. This show has some human like quality that makes the show seem down-to-earth and relevant to many people. It does not have the fan base popularity that other teenage shows have, but it nevertheless has a very loyal set of viewers who tune in every week to watch the latest comings and goings on in Tree Hill.There are some very good episodes of this show, but some others that aren't so good. But the show always churns out consistently good episodes and this means it is much harder to judge how good the show really is in its genre. If you want to see a good solid teenage drama that deals with real issues, in a human way, this is the show for you. Don't miss it 10/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368530/?ref_=sr_i_10

It seems to hit so many right notes without pushing anything too far, the comedy is just right, the emotional moments, just right, the cheese, the action, just right. It also does a great job of leaving the viewer to decide who the real heroes and villains are because unlike the movies nothing here is black and white. If you've seen the films, you will really enjoy this. If you haven't, you'll probably really enjoy it anyway.

Nyad,7.1,"['Annette Bening', 'Jodie Foster', 'Anne Marie Kempf', 'Carolyn McCormick', 'Marcos D√≠az']",Jimmy Chin,2023.0,sport,"Greetings again from the darkness. All great athletes aren't great competitors, and all great competitors aren't great athletes. But when the two merge, the result is elite. Think Michael Jordan, Muhammed Ali, Novak Djokovic, Tiger Woods, and Michael Phelps. Of course, there are others, and this biopic focuses on one you might not have previously considered since she's so unique. Diana Nyad was a world class distance swimmer and had a tremendous career prior to becoming an analyst and commentator for ABC Sports. She had a career that made her famous in her field and a well-respected sports personality ... but that's not what made her the focus of this film from co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, the Oscar winning duo behind the extraordinary documentary FREE SOLO (2018).In 2010, after a surprise 60th birthday party thrown for her by her friend Bonnie Stoll, Diana Nyad made up her mind to make the ""Mount Everest"" of open water swims ... from Cuba to Florida. Mind you, Nyad had failed on her attempt at this swim when she was 28 years old and in peak form. And yes, everyone thought she was a bit crazy and tried to talk her out of it. The swim is 103 miles, and the dangers included box jellyfish, sharks, and unpredictable weather and currents, not to mention the stamina and physical health required. But Diana would not be swayed from her goal.Annette Bening stars as Nyad, and two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster co-stars as best friend Bonnie. As remarkable as Nyad's marathon swim goal was, much of the film focuses on the journey of friendship between Diana and Bonnie, especially once Bonnie takes on the role of coach and trainer. Their relationship (and the actors' performances) is the strength of the film. We feel the love and the frustrations. Diana's extreme level of determination (and hard-headedness) is paired with her equally extreme level of self-absorption and narcissism. Bonnie's loyalty is tested daily and over many years.Why many years? The answer to that is in the number of failures Nyad experiences on her quest to complete the swim. The multiple attempts allow us to get familiar with the crew, especially navigator John Bartlett, played by the always interesting Rhys Ifans. The relationship between the crew and the swimmer builds the bridge between isolation and team sport. We see Diana use 4/4 music for the rhythm of her strokes and to keep her mind from wandering (or worse). The mental aspect of distance swimming is just as challenging as the physical side.The story continues through 2013 at age 64, when we learn that the rules mean both ankles must be out of the water for the swim to count ... this after more than two full days and nights of swimming. Screenwriter Julia Cox has adapted the story from Diana Nyad's memoir, ""Find a Way"", and Oscar winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (LIFE OF PI) works wonders in capturing the enormity of the swim as well as the intimacy of this deep friendship and the commitment of the crew.Flashbacks of Diana's childhood are shown, which clue us in on what motivated her to push her body and mind to extremes. The film begins with a recap of Nyad's swimming career to ensure that viewers understand what a decorated athlete she was. Annette Bening is terrific here and it will be interesting to see if, after four previous nominations, this is the role that delivers that elusive gold statue. As for Jodie Foster, her rare screen appearances make it too easy to forget just how amazing she can be - it's nice to be reminded (be on the lookout for her in the new season of ""True Detective"" next year). Music by two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat works well on the swims, and Nyad's dreams (and misses) inspire us to pursue our own ... even if our dreams are a bit less dramatic than ""Mount Everest.""

Friday Night Lights,8.7,"['Kyle Chandler', 'Connie Britton', 'Zach Gilford', 'Aimee Teegarden', 'Brad Leland']",Creator,2006.0,sport,"What a fantastic show. Yes, football is a huge aspect of this show, but in the way that it's a backdrop rather than the focus for the most part. I like to think of Friday Night Lights as similar to The O.C. and at the same time, completely anti-O.C. The thing about this show is, it deals with some issues that you see all the time on The O.C. - alcoholism, drugs, cheating, high school stuff...and yet, it comes off infinitely ahead of The O.C. It's in the treatment, the way they execute the story lines where the difference is, and that difference is MASSIVE. It's the difference between a guilty-pleasure borderline soap and a sophisticated and earnestly dramatic piece of film-making. This show takes those elements that could be turned into melodramatic/stereotypical clich√©s, that could be simplified into the escapist world of The O.C., and it manages to wring out every inch of raw emotion and drama out of them. It doesn't put its moments to waste. I really don't think I ever saw a moment of honest, real emotion in The O.C.. Friday Night Lights easily has three powerful and honest moments an episode, if not more. Besides the stuff that is similar to The O.C., the series also tackles more issues like racism, mental disorders, rape, and parent/child relationships. In fact, the two episodes that deal with racism are a great example of how FNL is so great. It showcases a lot of viewpoints from different people inside the show, and while it doesn't solve things completely (just like real life), it certainly shows more insight into the issues than most shows or movies I can think of. If Crash won an Oscar for its simplified and stereotypical view of racists and racism, the complexity in the way FNL deals with the issue should've made it the Best Picture of the century.That's not to say the stories themselves are perfect. When I step back and look back at the season of FNL, yeah, a lot of the story lines can seem at the end of the day overwrought and almost melodramatic. But that's the nature of the story lines. In the moments themselves, they are almost always written believably with perfect dialogue and acting. There are a few moments in the series where a character's turnaround or change of opinion might happen too drastically, but considering the 100 things they do right in every episode, 1 small problem like that per episode is really not much in the long run. There is always a fine line between melodrama and drama when dealing with shows about high school, and FNL hits the dramatic mark more consistently often than nearly anything else on TV or on the silver screen. The other thing is, like I said, FNL has a lot of raw and powerfully emotional moments in it. It wears its heart on its sleeve and some people may mistake that for melodrama. These are characters you care for, that are intensely real - yes, so the girls in the show may be hotter than most, the cast is good-looking, etc...but the root of the characters feels like real people. The actors feel naturalistic, and the breadth of the show is stunning. You feel like this town actually exists somewhere. It's not just about the high school kids either. This show is equally about the parents. This is a show about an entire town, a town that is in love with football, that lives for football because, well, quite simply, most of them have nothing to look forward to except for football. It really nails the closeness and intensity of living in a small town, of everyone knowing everyone, etc. If I had to use one word to describe what I think Friday Night Lights is about, it would be - dreams. This comes to the surface towards the end of the season but its always been there since the beginning. This show is about everyone's dreams, how and what everyone wants out of life, where they wanna go, where they seem themselves in the future.

Southpaw,7.3,"['Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Oona Laurence', 'Forest Whitaker', '50 Cent']",Antoine Fuqua,2015.0,sport,"Billy Hope is the light heavyweight champion of the world with a 43-0 record. One day, as a result of his uncontrollable violent temper, tragedy after tragedy hits him and his family until he is left with nothing -- not his fortune, not his career, not his family. Despondent and desperate to get his life back, Billy swallows his pride and seeks the assistance of trainer Tick Wills to train him back to fighting form.""Southpaw"" is an acting showcase for its lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Last year in the film ""Nightcrawler"", Gyllenhaal gave us all the creeps with his very realistic portrayal of sociopathic pseudo-video journalist Louis Bloom. He was overlooked at the Oscars of the Best Actor nomination he clearly deserved. With this meaty role, Gyllenhaal set out to prove that that his transformative performance last year was not a fluke at all.His performance here as Billy Hope is another triumph of his very serious and committed method acting style. Here, Gyllenhaal again undergoes a total physical transformation into a grizzled prizefighter with a buff hardened physique, scarred face and swollen eye. We feel every ache of his weary body as he shuffles in his gait. His speech is already slurred with probable nerve damage. We see and sense the ravages of his vicious sport on him.He captured the character of an impulsive man who was not too savvy in life, and easily driven to violently angry tendencies. As Billy's world collapses around him, Gyllenhaal brings us all down to his hell with him. We totally see the unraveling of a man until a mere shadow of him remained. Then we would witness how he humbles himself as he tries to bring the shattered pieces of his life back together again. This was in addition to all the pounding he had in the boxing ring itself. This was truly an acting tour de force by Gyllenhaal which simply cannot be ignored.The actors in supporting roles all share in Gyllenhaal's shine. Despite her name being so prominent in the poster, Rachel McAdams appeared on screen only for a very short time. In that limited time, we clearly see the effect of her strong character Maureen on her husband Billy. Bespectacled little Oona Laurence plays their spirited daughter Leila. Gyllenhaal and Laurence share some pretty intensely emotional scenes together.Forest Whitaker plays Tick Wills, the tough disciplinarian of a trainer whom Billy chose to bring him back on track. I thought it was clever how they even include Whitaker's left eye into the story. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Smith plays Billy's fair-weather manager Jordan Mains. He really has this sleazy vibe about him with his flashy smile and shiny suits.Director Antoine Fuqua effectively wrung all the right emotions out of this story. The storytelling is well-paced and the camera work is compelling. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and executed on screen -- very brutal, bloody, all with high tension. The first person point of view during the fights puts you right in the midst of all the action.The musical score contributes so much to the drama of this film. This is also the last film James Horner scored before his untimely demise in a plane crash recently. We also hear Eminem rap in the soundtrack. It is interesting to note that Eminem was actually the original choice to play Billy Hope.Boxing is a common sport tackled in movies because of its inherent drama. ""Rocky"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Fighter"" easily come to mind as among the best of them ever made. This is why we may feel we have seen this story In ""Southpaw"" told in another way before. However, the grippingly honest acting of Jake Gyllenhaal definitely set this film apart from others. He made ""Southpaw"" a most extraordinary boxing film to watch. 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798684/?ref_=sr_i_18
The Replacements,6.6,"['Keanu Reeves', 'Gene Hackman', 'Brooke Langton', 'Orlando Jones', 'Faizon Love']",Howard Deutch,2000.0,sport,This movie is like Little Giants for adults. It's fun watching this brand of misfits come together and win football games. Gene Hackman is channeling his Hoosiers performance. It's easy to root for these guys. Where I wish the movie was better was with the actual football scenes. There are many times where the logic and editing of the games is way off (like taking a timeout after a kickoff to stop the clock).

It should be straight forward to win the national championship for the sixth year in a row with their standard routine. However Torrance discovers that Big Red had actually stolen the choreography from an inner city squad the Clovers led by the Isis (Gabrielle Union).It has the cutesy wacky sensibility of Clueless and the structure of a traditional sports movie. The sport just happens to be cheerleading. It's fun and it's silly. It has its irreverent moments led by a great performance from Kirsten Dunst.

It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/?ref_=sr_i_22

And the script avoids succumbing too much to sports drama cliches by always keeping the focus on personal triumph over merely winning the game. It's a human story in the shell of a Christian sports film.And these humans are brought wonderfully to life by these actors. Aside from a handful of poor supporting cast members, the leads really kill it-even the child actors.Dennis Quaid is the obvious standout, bringing so much life and emotion to his character that isn't necessarily on the page. His character's arc is the soul of this movie, and if there were any justice in the industry, Quaid would be in serious consideration for awards next year.Long live baseball, and long live Dennis Quaid.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8051894/?ref_=sr_i_24

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,6.6,"['Will Ferrell', 'John C. Reilly', 'Sacha Baron Cohen', 'Gary Cole', 'Michael Clarke Duncan']",Adam McKay,2006.0,sport,"When looking at the merits of a movie and decide whether it is good or not, one must think of the goal of the picture. Is it a serious film, designed to comment on society, or is the movie's job to merely entertain? I think we all know the answer to this one when it comes to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. This movie's goal is to entertain the audience, make them laugh, make them spend an hour and a half rejoicing in talented comedians doing their job well. And this movie reached its goal. Not only is this movie an above-average sports movie (it even concludes with a big race and a warm and fuzzy winner!), but is also a very funny movie. All I had to do was listen to the reaction of the sold out theater I was in and I knew that most people will find this movie to be very funny. Will Ferrell is Ricky Bobby, a NASCAR driver who makes up one half of ""Shake and Bake,"" with John C. Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. being the ""Bake"" half of the duo. They are childhood friends who have now become teammates on the top NASCAR level, where Cal sets up the play that lets Ricky win almost every race--that is, unless Ricky has already crashed out of it. Talladega Nights follows the same story arc that Days of Thunder did, but is far more entertaining, as Ferrell and Reilly work together to bring humor to all parts of the racer's lives, including a bizarre dinner ritual that includes corporate sponsorship. Sure, the movie slows down for about 20 minutes in the middle to develop plot, but that may have been designed to give us, the audience, a break, allowing us to get ready for the final scenes of the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen (aka Ali G, Borat) plays the French Formula 1 driver who threatens to oust Ricky Bobby as the best driver on the track, perhaps the funniest overall character in the movie. There is not one scene with Cohen in it that isn't funny. After watching this movie, it is clear why Will Ferrell takes his comedies so seriously (watch the extras on the Elf DVD to see Ferrell between scenes, he's not always ""on"" playing the clown on set)--he gets the results he's looking for. This movie is laugh-out-loud funny pretty much from start to finish, and seeing Gary Cole return to comedy as Ricky Bobby's father will bring back memories of Office Space for a moment, then this new character will win you over.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/?ref_=sr_i_29
Moneyball,7.6,"['Brad Pitt', 'Robin Wright', 'Jonah Hill', 'Philip Seymour Hoffman', 'Chris Pratt']",Bennett Miller,2011.0,sport,"Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and don't see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. It's his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one can't seem to hope for an 'experimental' sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of 'field' action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/?ref_=sr_i_30

Caddyshack,7.2,"['Chevy Chase', 'Rodney Dangerfield', 'Bill Murray', 'Ted Knight', ""Michael O'Keefe""]",Harold Ramis,1980.0,sport,"`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080487/?ref_=sr_i_32
Major League,7.2,"['Tom Berenger', 'Charlie Sheen', 'Corbin Bernsen', 'Margaret Whitton', 'James Gammon']",David S. Ward,1989.0,sport,"Let me preface this by saying I can't stand baseball; I find it to be one of the most boring sports out there.  With that said, I love this film. It has a great ""underdog"" story, some genuine comedy, great characters, and heart. It's a minor film, but it's thoroughly entertaining.  If more films could just be entertaining, I might go to the theater more often.The heart of this film is the characters.  We have the broken down veterans, the rookies, the love interest, the wise old coach, and the villain.   These are rather cliched characters, but they are written and performed so well, you don't notice.  Much of the humor arises out of character moments, which keeps it from becoming tired or dated.Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen were hot, coming off of the success of Platoon.  Corbin Bernsen was enjoying fame on LA Law.  Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes were relative unknowns who got a chance to shine.  And then there's Bob Uecker!  Uecker is the glue that brings everything together and he gets the best lines in the movie.You can't go wrong with a film like this.  Everything works well and a good time is had by all.

It's loaded with iconic scenes, such as wax on, wax off and the ultimate kick scene. This film is definitely worth your time.This film helped bring a martial arts story to the masses, prior to that, you could argue that many of the martial arts themed films had something of a niche appeal,It always saddened me that Ralph Macchio didn't have a great career after this film, you would have thought that this would have set him up, it didn't, fortunately Cobra Kai had helped to redress the balance.The follow up films and the remake are all below average, and perhaps better off avoided, if you've not seen Cobra Kai, I would recommend it, it truly is the great follow up that this film deserved.Worth seeing.8/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/?ref_=sr_i_35

My biggest fear was that the new show would lose this and become too 'Americanised', but fortunately this hasn't happened.The camera work is phenomenal and the opening sequence was like something out of a movie.

This is where Air comes in.Right from the very start, the movie brings you along for the journey, engaging at every possible moment instead of just telling it to your face. The script was really well written to achieve this.The acting was too notch, particularly from Damon and Davis. At times you forget they are portraying real people.It was surprisingly funny at times and whilst you know the end of the story, the movie still gets you routing for everything to work out.For me, this is the first Oscar worthy film of the year (primarily for acting and screenplay) but credit should also be given to Afflecks direction.

Rocky,8.1,"['Sylvester Stallone', 'Talia Shire', 'Burt Young', 'Carl Weathers', 'Burgess Meredith']",John G.

Everything about his life spells ""underdog""-- he's even left-handed. He lives alone in a shabby apartment, and when he's not slowly being swept aside at the local gym, where even the trainer calls him a bum, he fauns over an introverted pet store clerk named Adrian.He gets his first break when he's chosen at random by heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, to take a shot at his title. No one thinks he can beat Creed-- not even Rocky. All Rocky wants is to be able to go all ten rounds with the champ, because no one else has. And in the final ten minutes of the film, Rocky finds out just how far he can go.What's terrific about this movie is that it's about Rocky. It's not about winning; it's not even about fighting. It's about Rocky and his desire to get by in the world without being a bum. The sequels to this widely popular film have focused more heavily on the upcoming fight, whereas this story focuses on Rocky's life.

Miracle,7.4,"['Kurt Russell', 'Patricia Clarkson', 'Nathan West', 'Noah Emmerich', 'Sean McCann']",Gavin O'Connor,2004.0,sport,"I was too young to have known anything about this game when it was played in real life, but it was definitely more than a game. It concerned world politics and the cold war. The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don't know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.FINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don't miss this one.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349825/?ref_=sr_i_40

They gave it a solid 10/10, so for the audience that doesn't want anything serious - this is hella perfect.The story wasn't anything new that we haven't seen before but it serves the movie good. My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like ""Godzilla vs Kong"", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.The direction by Adam Wingard is pretty good. The action in particulat is really well done and you can really see what's going on.The actors were OK for the most part but for the script they are given, they are fine.Giant praise to the VFX. Everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place, not like ""Captain Marvel 2"" for example, which had a 300 million dollar budget and for the money, it looked awful.The music is good too. I wouldn't buy a soundtrack but it served the story.Overall if you just want to have fun for 2 hours, this movie is perfect.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14539740/?ref_=sr_i_1
Road House,6.2,"['Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Daniela Melchior', 'Conor McGregor', 'Billy Magnussen', 'Jessica Williams']",Doug Liman,2024.0,thriller,"I'll open by saying that I've never seen the Patrick Swayze one, but if you're worried about this film ruining the original, there's already a direct to DVD sequel in the 2000s you should hate more.Now to this movie...I'm a big UFC fan, but I'm not a Conor fan, and I also like good action movies and cheesy action movies. This is the latter. I liked it. Overall, I thought it was slightly better than a ""one time watch"" movie. It's in the dumb fun category, basically.I liked Gylanhaal in the interpreter, and I thought he was was decent here. Furthermore, some of the fight choreography was good. The setting and story were ok, and even though it's over 2 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't drag too much. Conor (who is basically playing an exaggerated version of himself) was entertaining, and I thought the UFC angle was integrated well into the plot. This film also has a lot of humor and I found that a decent amount of it landed. One henchman (I'll try to keep this spoiler free) had me laughing often.Now to the negatives: some of the acting is bad, like really bad. The sheriff guy in particular, although he isn't the only one. Then there's the VFX. Oh my gosh, they are bad. This movie looks like it was made in iMovie at points. They also did some CGI body double thing to make the punches land during the fight scenes and at best, they are unnoticeable, and at worst, look awful. There's another scene where a character is hit with a car (all done in CGI) and it looks like Sharknado.For a remake of a cheesy ""so bad it's good"" movie from the 80s that also feels like an athlete's vanity project, you could do much worse. I was looking forward to watching this one hoping it would be fun. Obviously, I wasn't expecting Goodfellas. And when the movie was over, I felt mostly satisfied. I would probably watch it again, but likely years later and not right now.If this seems like a movie you'd be interested in, and you have Prime, check it out out of curiosity and grab some beers before you do. I already have Prime so the fact it was essentially free for me gives it some points in its favor.I don't regret watching it.

He's a great actor and he knows exactly what he's doing, sharp, precise, intense, on top of his acting skills.Zaillian stretches the story out here, (sometimes a little bit too much in the last three episodes), taking 8 hours, compared to shorter former versions. I must say I like all versions, because Highsmith's original story is of genius quality, and it allows to open a lot of doors to different interpretations. I loved Alain Delon in the Rene Clement classic, as well as Matt Damon in the luscious Minghella version, but comparing the different interpretations in detail would take to long.About this one: Yes, I loved that it was shot in atmospheric black and white (fantastic cinematography, every frame a piece of art!), I loved that this version was slow, I loved that it was so dark, I loved the sardonic humour.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me here.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11016042/?ref_=sr_i_3

He stars in it and is in acting form, and it's all really good in the giant size super screen I watched it in.I see that Dev has done his homework, the whole feel is of early Clint Eastwood crime films - 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot', 'Joe Kid' plenty of Bruce Lee film references -'Enter the dragon' and others,the night time is captured also reminds me of Scorsese -'Mean Streets' quite a bit.The story of revenge is handed differently with the dream sequences and the use of Indian gods, spiritualism its very prevalent and plays a large role in the plot and the movement of the movie, which changes the whole dynamic and speed, it takes it time to get where it needs too. Kind of like Paul Andrew Williams film-'Bull' which is very similar to this in certain ways, that also is a another film that pulls off another Clint Eastwood film, that is' High Plains Drifter'.You get plenty of blood and violence in this, with a superb acting and roles, but, and there is a but, Dev's direction is slightly off the mark with the close up shots being too close and framing of shots in this, that is why it misses the 8/10 mark.

Abigail,5.8,"['Dan Stevens', 'Kathryn Newton', 'Giancarlo Esposito', 'Matthew Goode', 'Melissa Barrera']",Matt Bettinelli-Olpin,2024.0,thriller,"The premise is simple, yet enticing. A group of criminals kidnap a little girl who's the daughter of a powerful underworld figure. Left with this girl as they prepare to collect the ransom from her father, they eventually find out that this little girl has quite the bite to her, and they must band together if they hope to survive the night together.Team Radio Silence have already established themselves as one of the most promising horror collectives in recent memory. Their work in the V/H/S franchise, Ready Or Not, and the latest two SCREAM movies have proven that they are a capable and reliable directorial team. So with this latest film, the question remained: would they keep their winning streak going with this one?Fortunately, this film is a blast and a half. This team have delivered what I'd argue is their best film since Ready Or Not. The action takes a second as the movie develops its central characters and gives us reasons to know them beyond their Rat Pack-inspired names. When the blood starts flowing, though, this movie takes off and flies with absolute gusto! The comedy lands SO many times here, and the actual action/gore sequences deliver in SPADES!The all-star cast excels with this. Melissa Barrera, reuniting with Team Radio Silence after the SCREAM films, shines as the central protagonist. We feel for her and why she does what she does, especially when we learn of her past. Dan Stevens is a foul-mouthed scene-stealer in this, and Kathryn Newton has a number of her own moments here. Giancarlo Esposito and the late Angus Cloud do just as well in smaller roles. The absolute standout, though, is Alisha Weir as the titular vampire. She knocks it out of the park in every scene she's in, and really makes the whole experience worth it.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Check it out with a group of friends when you can, as this movie is best viewed with a crowd.

Road House,6.7,"['Patrick Swayze', 'Kelly Lynch', 'Sam Elliott', 'Ben Gazzara', 'Marshall R. Teague']",Rowdy Herrington,1989.0,thriller,"Patrick Swayze, a classically trained ballet dancer, plays Dalton, who is hired to be the head bouncer (the ""cooler"") of a wild bar down in the bayou called the Double Deuce. Things get a little out of hand when the local mob boss (played by Ben Gazzara, perhaps better known as The Big Lebowski's Jackie Treehorn) wants to fight. Luckily, Dalton has a friend... an old-time bouncer played by Sam Elliott.This film is mentioned as Dawson Leery's (from ""Dawson's Creek"") favorite movie, which seems really odd for a character who emulates Spielberg. The film is non-stop fight scenes that extend into full bar brawls. Okay, wait, not non-stop... there's also a fair amount of sex. Sex and nudity (both male and female). You will see more of Sam Elliott than you ever thought you would. And then back to the fighting.The bar brawls were enough to earn it the title of ""Second Best Fight Movie Ever"" (behind ""They Live"", though the choreography of ""Clockwork Orange"" is impressive) in my mind, but then the fights turn grotesquely violent. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. I find this to be the selling point of the film, knowing that Dalton has the strength and training to rip a man's windpipe out through his neck. Yet, he has the cool calmness of a zen master (one wonders how his majoring in philosophy fits into his character... if at all).There are a few things that seem strange if you're being picky. All stores and houses are packed wall to wall with propane tanks apparently, as explosions happen for no reason. Cops don't show up for fires, bar fights or the destruction of an entire car dealership (by a monster truck). They do show up once in the film without being called, when their presence no longer matters.This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again. Not because it's a great film (although it is pretty darn good)... but because its absurdity is, well, absurd. The film takes place in a universe I can only dream of. Which, being a late 1980s film, I guess makes it perfectly normal in some way. Well, whatever the case, I loved it and you should love it, too.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/?ref_=sr_i_8

True Detective,8.9,"['Vince Vaughn', 'Colin Farrell', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Taylor Kitsch', 'Matthew McConaughey']",Creators,2014.0,thriller,"Watch the show and make up your own mind. I've seen too many people regurgitating the same ""SEASON 1 IS AMAZING, SEASON 2 IS THE WORST OF ALL TIME"" junk, and it's simply not true.Fact of the matter is this is an anthology series. Different people, different stories, different feels. If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015. Just goes to show that some people have no clue how to manage their expectations, and this site is no different. Look at what I've said, and now put it up against so many here...it's ridiculous.Like I said: watch it and make up your own mind. I avoided it for 5 years because of this site and I regret it.

Even though the quality has gone down in recent years I still haven't missed an episode. While the last few seasons weren't quite as good they were still worth watching. It did go out on a high note though, the last season was actually pretty good. It had a few slow filler episodes but overall it was solid. Even though it was definitely time for it to end I'm still going to miss it. When something's been apart of your life for so long it's hard to say goodbye. The good news for fans is that there are a few spinoffs coming in 2023. I'm actually interested in the spinoffs considering they all star my favorite characters from the main show. There's three of them so far...one with Rick & Michonne, one with Negan & Maggie and one with Darryl going over to Europe.

However, it is still not Halo, but damn if season two has not had a few bangers of episodes and you actually care about these characters now, unlike season one. Not sure what changed behind the scenes, but it was a good thing, whatever happened.I watched season one because of the effects, which were pretty great! Now, I'm watching because of the story too, which is pretty good! I used to watch the old school Doctor Who because of the story, not the effects budget, which was probably about $150.

The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16418808/?ref_=sr_i_13

I re-watched them several times because they are pure masterpieces. Then, Season 9 came around, and I was so disappointed and couldn't stop questioning whether it was made by the same people who had created all the previous seasons. In season 10, things got even worse. While the first part of the season seemed promising, its finale turned out to be so underwhelming that I felt really let down. Being so disenchanted by it, I couldn't pass even the first episode of the second installment, which, in general, appeared super unappealing. Moving on to this last season, the first episode of Season 11 is such a bummer that I'm not going to continue watching this show anymore. That's enough! It's official, AHS is dead. I was asking myself the whole time while watching that ridiculous episode what it even had to do with AHS. Where is a horror in this story? Where are all the great characters?

I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is.

Masters of the Air,7.9,"['Callum Turner', 'Anthony Boyle', 'Austin Butler', 'Darragh Cowley', 'Matt Gavan']",All cast & crew,2024.0,thriller,"After the first couple episodes I was pretty hesitant to continue with the series. It felt like a poorly hashed out, over dramatized Band of Brothers, which is one of the best shows of all time. So, the bar was high, sure, but not so that you couldn't tell a similar, respectable story about the American airmen of WWII, but it didn't really feel too much like that, not until the final half of the show. The pacing of the entire series does feel a bit odd, however, as the Americans were only in the war for a few years (and, yes, much to the point of a lot of these reviews, slandered the Brits who were fighting much longer, in an unnecessary exchange that was meant to develop characters which felt like getting soggy wet bread thrown in your face) so, we jump through time quite a bit (around 3 years in 9 episodes) with little indication that time has progressed by months at a time, until we end up in late 1944/early 1945 in the final episode, at which point the timeline becomes less convoluted but also less consistent with the rest of the show's pacing. Which is important, and which its predecessor succeeded at marvelously, because this is a historical drama with real events and real people that can't be conflated with nonsensical fictional musings else it completely removes the media from any sincerity it might have had. Which was the case in some of the earlier episodes, but as the story progressed and the notion that quite a few of these characters that are being played up as important suddenly vanish for perhaps good, lends itself to the reality of war. Which is where war films are at their inherent best, because war is bad and playing it up as some sort of glamorous and heroic endeavor is abjectly antithetical to the reality these types of shows and movies aim to capture. This is simple stuff, so it shouldn't even be mentioned, especially over 20 years after Band of Brothers and over 50 years (90 since the original original) after All Quiet on the Western Front demonstrated what it means to tell these stories honestly. Ultimately, I feel this show did accomplish that feat, but it wasn't until the latter half that it really honed in on the realism and avoided the tedious, fabricated melodrama that riddle Apple TV shows. I feel like this series is worth the watch, it definitely takes its time getting there, but it succeeds, and succeeds well when it does. 7.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2640044/?ref_=sr_i_20

He was short, paunchy and had a beard the size of Indiana. When you see a move ""based"" on a book or ""based"" on a true story, you would hope at least some of it was reasonably accurate. Some aspects of this series are accurate to a degree. Most, not so much. As drama, it's fine. But, why take a remarkable true story and burden it with unbelievable situations? History is inherently fascinating when played straight. This is a mishmash. The acting is adequate, the production values satisfactory, but so much is lost with the storytelling.

I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still.

Like they watched Pumping Iron instead of visiting the nearest gym. It's like if Pumping Iron was a raunchy, lesbian, blood-soaked psychedelic experience. With a dash of crime family drama.I found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it's not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it's mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good. It took me a while to realize I recognized Katy O'Brian from The Mandalorian. I loved that she was homeless but still working out; if she can get swole living under a bridge, what's your excuse? Lol.Theres a huge emphasis on smoking and drugs, it's a pretty big theme and mostly referenced on the radio. The story is alright, there's a love, crime and family drama.It's quite raunchy. I wasn't expecting that, but I suppose the movie did give off those vibes. I just didn't watch any trailers or anything and went in blind. It also included some other adult/mature content like domestic violence. It's quite gory as well. Initially, it felt like it was penned by a man; I was surprised to learn it was written/directed by a woman afterward. I recall thinking that there will probably be a lot of people commenting on this, expressing their displeasure with how women are portrayed in movies written by men.The movie had several moments where I thought to myself, well that's taken a weird turn. It gets more weird and weirder the longer in goes. It's really weird that it was common/normal back then to just hit your wife. It was jarring to watch. Franco's character is probably the worst one.It's also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it's just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love. I didn't really find myself rooting for anyone and l didn't feel particularly attached to the movie as a whole. I feel like it could've been better, and by better I mean more psychedelic, more violent, maybe even disturbing. It's not a movie for everyone, but it's pretty interesting and I enjoyed it. I like it but I don't know if it'll still be on my mind a month from now.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19637052/?ref_=sr_i_23

It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first.

Instead they forged ahead and proved they don't understand the story and characters or why the setting was just as important.Instead of the Colombian jungle with dangers around every corner including cliff-side roads, fallen trees, rivers with sketchy bridges, wildlife, etc, they chose to set this in the middle of the boring desert with long stretches of flat, easily-traversed roads and nothing of interest to even look at.The original opens with a hyper-patient study of the characters who will eventually take up the challenge, while Sorceror uses pre-Colombia vignettes to introduce the characters and their reasons for ending up together.This one opens with a pounding score that can't save one of the most boring ""action"" sequences I've ever seen. It's shot like a Honda Civic commercial, but then becomes more laughable when one of the vehicles gets stuck on a small hump because the driver (and director) apparently don't realize they are in a 4WD truck (or understand how motor vehicles in general work). The other vehicle pulls up and they chat about needing to go, but driver 1 is adamant about not leaving behind the (pointless MacGuffin). The other driver takes off, but SURPRISE(?), circles around to push the other truck over the speed bump. So exciting...Not. Meanwhile, somehow the vehicle that was in hot pursuit is conveniently much farther back than was previously shown.We get a boring shootout that is somehow resolved and then a sex scene that provides no character development and further demonstrates a complete unawareness by the writer and director of the setting in which they placed their ""remake""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27487473/?ref_=sr_i_28

The story was beyond imagination, really epic, and it's not about one single country or one single culture, you can see every nation, every race united together when facing danger. The TV series tried to make everything the same as the book. One star was deducted because the pacing of story telling, all the flashbacks and neon lights scenes are a bit annoying and confusing, when not everyone knows the background of the story.

It's largely dialogue heavy and not afraid to take its time. It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.Director Shyamalan doesn't get much respect from the critics, but screw the critics, he did brilliantly here from writing to directing.And James McAvoy deserves every acting award for 2019. Might as well just give him all of them now, best actor, best actress, best child actor, etc., all of them, because no one's topping this performance.And about the action, I saw director Shyamalan talking in an interview about how he's mainly interested in drama and that action is not his strong point, but he was really downplaying his handling of the action, because the fight scenes here are legitimately awesome. Glass thankfully features none of the shaky rapid-editing style that plagues so many other action movies. It is all well shot, so you'll have no trouble following the action. We even see lots of unusually artistic camera shots during the action, such as showing long close up shots of people's faces while they're in the middle of fighting. My favorite was a long held shot from the point of view of being inside a van while we're seeing a fight happening outside, as the combatants are circling around and slamming into the van. That was just plain cool, the kind of shot that's just mind-boggling to think about how they managed to pull it off.And don't trust the rotten critics. Just don't. They're so worthless, those critics. They're wrong about almost every movie these days.

Madame Web,3.8,"['Dakota Johnson', 'Sydney Sweeney', 'Isabela Merced', ""Celeste O'Connor"", 'Tahar Rahim']",S.J.

It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11057302/?ref_=sr_i_33
Dexter,8.6,"['Michael C. Hall', 'Jennifer Carpenter', 'David Zayas', 'James Remar', 'C.S. Lee']",Creator,2006.0,thriller,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined.

Masters of the Air,7.9,"['Callum Turner', 'Anthony Boyle', 'Austin Butler', 'Darragh Cowley', 'Matt Gavan']",All cast & crew,2024.0,war,"After the first couple episodes I was pretty hesitant to continue with the series. It felt like a poorly hashed out, over dramatized Band of Brothers, which is one of the best shows of all time. So, the bar was high, sure, but not so that you couldn't tell a similar, respectable story about the American airmen of WWII, but it didn't really feel too much like that, not until the final half of the show. The pacing of the entire series does feel a bit odd, however, as the Americans were only in the war for a few years (and, yes, much to the point of a lot of these reviews, slandered the Brits who were fighting much longer, in an unnecessary exchange that was meant to develop characters which felt like getting soggy wet bread thrown in your face) so, we jump through time quite a bit (around 3 years in 9 episodes) with little indication that time has progressed by months at a time, until we end up in late 1944/early 1945 in the final episode, at which point the timeline becomes less convoluted but also less consistent with the rest of the show's pacing. Which is important, and which its predecessor succeeded at marvelously, because this is a historical drama with real events and real people that can't be conflated with nonsensical fictional musings else it completely removes the media from any sincerity it might have had. Which was the case in some of the earlier episodes, but as the story progressed and the notion that quite a few of these characters that are being played up as important suddenly vanish for perhaps good, lends itself to the reality of war. Which is where war films are at their inherent best, because war is bad and playing it up as some sort of glamorous and heroic endeavor is abjectly antithetical to the reality these types of shows and movies aim to capture. This is simple stuff, so it shouldn't even be mentioned, especially over 20 years after Band of Brothers and over 50 years (90 since the original original) after All Quiet on the Western Front demonstrated what it means to tell these stories honestly. Ultimately, I feel this show did accomplish that feat, but it wasn't until the latter half that it really honed in on the realism and avoided the tedious, fabricated melodrama that riddle Apple TV shows. I feel like this series is worth the watch, it definitely takes its time getting there, but it succeeds, and succeeds well when it does. 7.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2640044/?ref_=sr_i_5
The Zone of Interest,7.5,"['Christian Friedel', 'Sandra H√ºller', 'Johann Karthaus', 'Luis Noah Witte', 'Nele Ahrensmeier']",Jonathan Glazer,2023.0,war,"There exists a series of clips of Adolf Hitler that, to a lot of people, is actually a lot harder to stomach than his enraged speeches and hateful bellows followed by thundering cheers. They show him during his downtime, playing with his kids and charming Eva Braun, acting not altogether unpleasant. As nauseating as the more well-known footage of him may be, there is something singularly disturbing -- even horrifying -- about the reminder that, yes, this monster was in fact human.The Zone of Interest, in a way, does for Holocaust films what that haunting clip does for WW2 footage. There are untold movies about this point in history that are horrific to watch; yet, they are movies we can accept. There is a disconnect between us and the ferocious, clearly evil Nazis. This movie, though it depicts next to no actual barbarity, may go down as the most harrowing of them all.Like Klondike, it is a war film whose horror comes not from images of violence, but from the casual way that violence is treated by those at the center of war, only this time, it is not from the vantage point of traumatized innocents. As Jeff Zhang's review points out, this is not the sort of Holocaust film that puts the atrocities of Nazi Germany in the preferred blunt terms: ""Its acts of evil -- oozing on the periphery of domestic rigamarole -- are designed to needle and splinter in the brain rather than suck the air out of the room: ashes of the dead in the river as nuisance, installing Auschwitz ovens like they're dishwashers, gunshots and wails of anguish heard but not seen...""More precisely, the movie follows a German man as he simply, well, spends time with his loving family at their lovely home -- which, as it happens, is situated right by the walls of one of the deadliest concentration camps of The Third Reich, whose death and suffering are acknowledged only when they ""intrude"" on the family's peace. The man is Rudolf H√∂ss, who was the Auschwitz commandant 1940-1943. One of the biggest stirs in the family is when he learns he may be promoted, possibly forcing them to move.In a genre that often forces us to look into Hell, this movie forces us to remain blind. To be clear, that's not to say that the truth is hidden; we're painfully aware of what's being kept from us as we're put in the comfort in which people sat, and continue to sit, while watching genocide from afar. And it isn't just the audience that Glazer puts into this position:The actors, particularly the leads Christian Fiedel and Sandra H√ºller, are eerily convincing and they may have ended up eerily CONVINCED during filming. All but forced to immerse themselves in the lives of the H√∂sses, they sometimes weren't informed where exactly the cameras were located -- only that certain rooms in the H√∂ss household contained cameras (sometimes they didn't even get to hear which ones). The actors go about the family's routines, presented to us in real time. This Cach√©-esque cinematography only strengthens the feeling that we're sitting somewhere in the house, watching; hearing what they hear; forced to ignore what they ignore.Basically, this is not akin to such Holocaust dramas as Schindler's List, Son of Saul, or Come and See; however, it isn't quite a film like Shoah either -- a movie that, whereas some would insist that we have a duty to ""depict"" Nazi violence so that it's clear to future generations this mustn't happen again, suggests that it cannot be done, and so relies solely on the words of survivors, letting our minds fill in the rest. In the words of David Ehlrich, The Zone of Interest ""splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre""; other reviews view it as a reaction to Godard and Haneke's statements re: Schindler's List, accusing Spielberg of trying to make suffering entertaining.This is indeed a film that sticks in your brain. It leaves us horrified, not that people like the H√∂sses existed and still exist amongst us, but that the movie may simply be a mirror -- here we sit, in a warm building in comfortable chairs as lives are ended by the day in Palestine, Congo, Sudan, and several others that most of you probably haven't even heard of yet. There is a world of difference between being uninformed and being an SS officer of course, but complicity takes many forms and both types of person are victims of the same propaganda. Now, will you look past the wall?By design, the movie doesn't have the sort of nightmarish visuals we may expect from Glazer; yet, there are shots of dark hallways and other pitch-black images where the darkness seems as alive and all-consuming as the liquid void from Under the Skin. (The music, by Mica Levi, during these moments was succinctly described by a YouTube commenter as ""the Universe mournfully sighing"".) While I recommend seeing the film in theaters -- in a setting where you can truly appreciate the sound design and purposeful imagery -- these particular sequences may work even better at home.On certain screens, when you stare into pitch blackness, you eventually discover your own face in it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7160372/?ref_=sr_i_6

Shogun,8.1,"['Richard Chamberlain', 'Toshir√¥ Mifune', 'Y√¥ko Shimada', 'Furank√Æ Sakai', 'Alan Badel']",All cast & crew,1980.0,war,"In 1976, James Clavell wrote an epic masterpiece: the story of Blackthorne, an English sailor lost in Feudal Japan. He gradually finds his place, oft the central pawn of political intrigues between various foreign powers and the local warlords. In 1980, this miniseries was unleashed on the world and created a whole new audience for the mammoth bestseller. No small feat considering the length and complexity of Clavell's 1200+ page door-stopper. Clocking in at almost 10 hours, this mega-budgeted series delivers the goods. People who have seen ""The Last Samurai"" might see a few plot similarities (even in certain smaller details: Tom Cruise sports exactly the same haircut as Richard Chamberlain). With all respect for the 2003 film, Shogun is far out of it's reach.Richard Chamberlain embodies Blackthorne to perfection, successfully gaining our empathy through an ambiguous yet very human performance. Supporting him are Japanese icon Toshiro Mifune as the shrewd warlord and aspiring shogun Torunaga, who befriends/manipulates Blackthorne, and Yoko Shimada as Blackthorne's translator, confident and friend. Every actor gives life to Clavell's carefully drawn and layered characters (most of all a very bombastic John Rhys-Davies). For a television miniseries, the technical specs are quite surprisingly good. Indeed the budget must have been quite important (and set a record at the time) but never is the story or it's rhythm scarified to show-off. The direction and photography are quite tasteful, often reminiscent of early Kurosawa, only in color. Maurice Jarre's score might not reach the lofty heights of his work for David Lean but it serves it's purpose.Many will tell you that the book is better. It is certainly more intimate and detailed, but a more faithful and excellent adaptation of such a rich book you are not likely to see anytime soon.

It's a very basic see it once and say you have seen it.

Napoleon,6.4,"['Joaquin Phoenix', 'Vanessa Kirby', 'Tahar Rahim', 'Rupert Everett', 'Mark Bonnar']",Ridley Scott,2023.0,war,"Napoleon was the most significant man of his age and no film can explain his significance in 2.5 hours. Scott decides to focus on three specific aspects of Napoleon's life and personality to show who he thinks Napoleon was at the expense of omitting much of what makes him such a fascinating figure in history.The first aspect Scott focuses on is Napoleon the lover. Much of this film shows his infatuation and on-again off-again relationship with Josephine. Both actors handle their parts well and while there is some humor and tension, it is the least interesting part of the movie. Still, some focus is necessary as his marriage to Josephine was certainly a key aspect of his life.The second aspect is Napoleon the megalomaniac. We all know of Napoleon as the short guy who had insecurity issues. Even if there is truth to this, it is probably an overstatement, but there is no denying the massive ego of the man. In many respects his ego is understandable for all he accomplished, and Scott paints Napoleon's inflated belief in himself as the reason for his fall, particularly in his invasion of Russia. Scott does not want us the think Napoleon fights for the glory of France but rather for the glory of Napoleon.The final side of the Napoleon casts him as a butcher. Towards the end of his career we see Napoleon recklessly spending the lives of his men as he seeks to conquer for himself. The movie leaves us with a comprehensive death toll that Napoleon left in his wake, a massive number that comes as a result of his callous disregard for his own men and endless ambition.So then we are left with a Napoleon as a man who loved Josephine, who had a massive ego, and constantly warred, causing the deaths of millions. All this is true, but what of Napoleon the tactician? What of Napoleon the reformer? What of Napoleon the leader? Scott focused on the worst aspects of Napoleon to highlight while disregarding the best. I was shocked that more was not discussed and shown over the massive victories and the unprecedented tactics he employed that make him a general still studied in military academies today. He was a multifaceted man, who accomplished much good and much bad, but he comes off in this film as a little ambitious fool.The film also seems jumbled at times and jumps forward in ways that show Napoleon must be conquering and doing something right, but he goes from general, to consul, to emporer in quick ways we are not shown. He beats Austria and Russa, befriends Russia, then is back at war with them one scene later. I understand the politics, battles, and alliances are hard to follow of the ealry 19th century, but I left feeling like I learned little more about Napoleon and the France he ruled than I already knew coming in.Despite the films shortcomings, it is a genuinely effective movie and shot beautifully. The battle scenes are bloody and tense, and the costumes and sets look recreate Napoleonic France beautifully.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13287846/?ref_=sr_i_12

Expend4bles,4.8,"['Jason Statham', '50 Cent', 'Megan Fox', 'Dolph Lundgren', 'Tony Jaa']",Scott Waugh,2023.0,war,"A film that should have been better, but unfortunately had a mediocre director.Not everything in the movie is bad, but overall this could have been a great movie.Well, let's start with the good stuff:Jason Statham works well in an action movie as usual. Stallone is in his element, although it would be better if he was a little more in the film. Iko Uwais is not bad at all as a villain and he is a good addition to the film. Andy Garcia is also a good choice for this movie. The rest of the team is mostly good, with a few exceptions, some should have maybe gotten a little more time in the movie.And now, the bad part:The biggest problem with this movie is the mediocre director. If they had a better director, this film could have been great, it turned out to be just tolerable, and that's because most of today's film production is garbage.There is too much ""shaky camera"" that makes every movie look worse than it really is. Such scenes simply look cheap.The CGI looks pretty bad, which is odd considering this isn't a cheap movie, but a bad director made it look cheap.The film lacks that real cinematic look, I don't know if it's because of the type of camera, so everything looks too artificial, it doesn't have the look that older films had, where everything looked monumental. This looks like a documentary, with ultra-sharp resolution, and yet it looks cheap, as if we're looking through a window.Basically, the director is the worst thing about this movie, everything else is not nearly as bad, not even some really hilarious casting choices.In the end, the film could have been great, it turned out to be just another mediocre film, and it's sad that even as such it is better than most of what ""modern film production"" offers us today.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3291150/?ref_=sr_i_14
Kingdom of Heaven,7.3,"['Orlando Bloom', 'Eva Green', 'Liam Neeson', 'Martin Hancock', 'Michael Sheen']",Ridley Scott,2005.0,war,"""Why was the Crusader braver then the pirate? Because he fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took Spain from us, though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic Church, we swept them back to Africa.""Clearly, director Ridley Scott does not agree with the above somewhat simplified philosophy expressed by Shaw through his character Don Juan. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", wars and battles are fuelled by an assortment of motivations including land, money, political consideration, natural desire for violence, lust for fame, love of the common people, among others. Even more importantly, this ""idea"" thing does not prevent leaders from practicing tolerance, reaching compromises and even recognizing equality with alien faiths, as the movie tries to show us. Recognizing that this movie is a mix of historical fact and dramatized fiction, let me focus on one rather unusual aspect of the hero Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith inheriting knighthood and an estate from a father appearing out of the blues. As Balian takes over the barren desert estate after the untimely death of the recently-discovered father, he does something that the father apparently has failed to do in all these years ¬ñ dig into the earth to find a reliable source of water and proceed to make the estate productive. Later, the resilient defence of Jerusalem owes just as much to Balian's knowledge of practical laws of mechanics as to his military skills. In the end, he turns away from the inherited knighthood and goes back to be a blacksmith, taking with him a queen. Triumph of the working class, as my summary line suggests.Depiction of the arch adversary Saladin follows very much the line taken in the novels of Sir Walter Scott (another Scott here!), particularly ""The Talisman"", as someone mysterious (to the extent of being almost omnipresent - in the novel) but wise and benevolent, a breed of political leader that is sadly in short supply today. The hero Balian, as mentioned, has little interest in divinity and every interest in the welfare of the people. These two leaders, put in today's context, could qualify ""Kingdom of Heaven"" for a fairy tale.It's difficult to refrain from comparing the attack of Jerusalem with the attack of Minas Tirith, and this very comparison can be construed as an unreserved compliment on Kingdom of Heaven. Another comparison that can be made is the depiction of a mighty army, done so unimaginatively in two similar movies last year. In Kingdom of Heaven, we see first a solitary figure on horseback at a distant mountain gap. ""Saladin's army of 200 thousand is here"" says Balian. ""There's only one person"", comes the reply from a follower. ""No, they're all here"" Balian quietly responses, at which point the angle of the camera starts to rise, first revealing the patch behind the mountain gap, filled with soldiers. Then, as the horizon of our vision continues to extend, layers of mountains and vales continue to appear, together with Saladin's mighty army deployed in an apparently haphazard, but ultimately strategic fashion. This must be seen to appreciate. Of the cast, I must first mention Edward Norton. As the leper king of Jerusalem, he appears all the time behind a mask which covers his entire face, showing only his eyes with disfigured corners. But it's the voice that is so mesmerizing. Ever since Fight Club, Norton's voice has such a timbre that soft as he sounds, there are lurking behind tantalizing hints of subtlety, intrigue, compassion, power, and twenty other different and conflicting emotions all at once.Bloom grows into his role, starting rather expressionless (which may not be totally unreasonable considering that the character has just lost a wife and a child) but gradually gaining in confidence. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, playing father and mentor respectively, do not exactly have the most challenging parts in their careers. Eva Green retains the girlish defiance in The Dreamer, but adds to it the maturity and allure required for the role of Sibylla (as portrayed by the script, but not necessarily as recorded in history). And there is good old Brendan Gleeson, in the customary role of big bully fighter which he has perfected in Gangs of New York and Troy. Kingdom of Heaven is one cut above Troy and Alexander last year.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320661/?ref_=sr_i_15

M*A*S*H,8.5,"['Alan Alda', 'Wayne Rogers', 'Loretta Swit', 'Jamie Farr', 'William Christopher']",Creator,1972.0,war,"I've found many of the comments about this series to be quite amusing, particularly the ones bashing it for ""shoving"" a liberal agenda down viewers throats.  Given it's success for 11 years, I don't think the audience seemed to agree with that assessment.  Quite simply, the show was one of the best written, best acted, and most entertaining shows in television history. Yes, it wore out its welcome in the end; but, it is a masterpiece that later shows rarely measured up to.I have no great preference for one season's cast over another.  Each character was unique and had something to contribute.  When we lost the bumbling, but loveable Henry Blake, we got the stern but loving Sherman Potter.  Both were the C.O., but each was a different person, a smart move by the creators. The same is true for Frank Burns and Charles Emerson Winchester III.  Burns was a neurotic, vindictive, childish fool; while Winchester was an arrogant blowhard, but one who could hold his own with Hawkeye.  Burns was incompetent, while Winchester was an outstanding surgeon; just ask him.  Characters were missed when they left; but, they were not replaced with doppelgangers.  That is part of the reason this show lasted so long.The show did take on a more serious tone in the later seasons, but not entirely.  There are plenty of laughs right up to the end.  Those serious shows were often some of the most memorable, and they kept the series from becoming stale.  With that said, they did tend to resort to Hawkeye's mental problems a bit too much, especially in the farewell.  You can argue that a character like Hawkeye, with his passion for preserving life, was ripe for mental breakdowns; but, in reality, he probably would have been shipped home by the second breakdown.The show is not perfect (it lasted 8 years longer than the actual war) but it comes far closer than most.  It seems to be fashionable to bash popular shows and movies after their days is over.  Part of this is a new generation trying to establish their own identity and dominance.  Well, I didn't like my parent's movies, shows and music when I was younger; until I actually watched them and listened to them.  Some of it turned out to be quite good, some not.  Real quality stands the test of time.  MASH will be around far longer than most of what I see on tv today.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098/?ref_=sr_i_19

As the opening of the show tells the viewer, ""You think you know a story but you only know how it ends. To get to the heart of a story you have to go back to the beginning."" I'm sure a lot of people watching the show are watching it for entertainment and not because of its historical accuracy. I personally love Tudor England and know a lot about it. The show takes many liberties, but that's why it's entertainment and not a biographic film on the King. It's fascinating to see what is kept of what many believe to be true and what is changed. Things such as basing Henry's sister Margaret after both his sister Mary and his older sister Margaret is very interesting turn. The first four episodes have been phenomenal works of cinematic art which I hope will continue on for seasons to come.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758790/?ref_=sr_i_20
Sisu,6.9,"['Jorma Tommila', 'Aksel Hennie', 'Jack Doolan', 'Mimosa Willamo', 'Onni Tommila']",Jalmari Helander,2022.0,war,"There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet!

The Pacific,8.3,"['James Badge Dale', 'Joseph Mazzello', 'Jon Seda', 'Ashton Holmes', 'Josh Helman']",All cast & crew,2010.0,war,"Please, for the love of God, please do not overlook this miniseries. I have seen way too many people who don't bother to see The Pacific because it wasn't like Band of Brothers. This was in no way, shape, or form meant to be like BoB. If you have studied WW2 at all, you would know that the war in the Pacific was a totally different war than the European theater. I loved Band of Brothers, it was a great and realistic series of the harsh realities of warfare and the scars it can leave. The Pacific was much harder to watch than BoB ever was. BoB was all about the bonds formed in combat and how this can tear people apart. This grim series displayed how completely unprepared the US military was mentally for how truly horrific this war would be. Not only were you fighting the unpredictable and relentless Japanese soldiers, but you were also fighting the terrain. The dense woods, the heavy rain, the thick mud. Not to mention all the diseases that came with these harsh conditions. Water was a luxury in a lot of situations. The filmmakers brilliantly showed how this affected the fighting men, who became virtually hollow shells, their sanity teetering on the edge of their knives. The Japanese killed everyone without remorse. One particular scene that gave me chills to witness was in the latter half of the series when a group of civilians was slaughtered by a Japanese machine gun nest while running to the American forces. One person, a child, started to crawl slowly to the lines, a couple bullet wounds on his body. One of the combat rookies wanted to run in to help the poor boy, but was kept back so they would not be shoot too. All the Marines could do was watch, as the helpless child was brutally killed after a bullet from that machine gun emplacement hit him in the back of the head and his body went limp instantaneously. This is on par with Saving Private Ryan, another collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as one of the most horrific, gruesome, and realistic war dramas ever put to film. I highly recommend giving it a watch, but be warned: this series is not for the faint of heart.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374463/?ref_=sr_i_22

Rome,8.7,"['Kevin McKidd', 'Ray Stevenson', 'Polly Walker', 'Kerry Condon', 'James Purefoy']",Creators,2005.0,war,"I Claudius was maybe the best miniseries ever. Now, there's Rome, and it's even better. I agree with another reviewer, that quibbles about historical inaccuracies, such as accents or how old so-and-so should be, are silly pedantry. I've been a Roman history buff ever since my own high school triumvirate of Caesar, Cicero and Virgil, and I say that this historical fiction is both exciting AND quite accurate with the important stuff.So far, every player has been terrific, in particular Ciar√°n Hinds as Caesar and Max Pirkis as Octavian. Julius Caesar was perhaps the most complex ""great"" figure in history. Was he a great populist, trying to champion the people against the Optimates, or was he an ambitious demagogue, who was using the Roman mobs to attain the imperium? Hinds depicts this complexity perfectly, while projecting a steely will that is shared by Caesar's emerging prot√©g√©, Octavian. Thanks to Max Pirkis's brilliant portrayal, we can already see the no-nonsense pragmatism, ruthlessness and brilliance that will propel this boy into becoming the greatest despot in history. And what about that dissolute Mark Anthony? We can already see Actium in his face. And with Atia, I think Livia (as depicted in I Claudius) and Messalina have met their match.And midst the struggle for mastery of Rome, we see the struggle of more common folk just to make a living. Rome makes the parallel stories of the Optimates and Centurian, now Prefect, Vorenus and Legionnaire Pullo a perfect vehicle for comparing the travails of different classes ¬ó their love lives, social lives, how they treated the servants, how they practiced their faiths, how they fought. Seen from these different perspectives (which we did not get with I Claudius), we get a three-dimensional view and, for me, the closest to feeling like one is actually there of any historical fiction ever produced.And look at the production values. Is it any wonder, when we see who's behind the camera ¬ó Michael Apted and John Milius ¬ó that we have an immaculately crafted work?By their commitment to quality of production and integrity of story, HBO and BBC are demonstrating what television can be. This is a wonderful, wonderful series. Anyone with a love of history, drama and spectacle should be devouring it with delight.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384766/?ref_=sr_i_26

The script is terrific, the actors are perfect, the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies, Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that ""legacy"". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect, but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past, she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead, which took me out of the film each time it played.

So few affect me like this one did.No special effects of note, no big budget, no set-pieces of note, no heroes, no redemption. I feel quite sure the director has really captured what war 'feels' like - unlike Spielberg and Coppola's depictions of war, this director lived through WW2 and the horrific siege of Stalingrad, as well as spending many months researching the massacres in Belarus, one of which he depicts in this film (this from the DVD extras, well worth watching).The direction, cinematography, soundtrack and AMAZING acting by a first-time untrained actor in the main role are faultless, in my humble opinion.I found this film depressing and emotionally draining, but cannot wait to watch it again.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/?ref_=sr_i_29

Dunkirk,7.8,"['Fionn Whitehead', 'Barry Keoghan', 'Mark Rylance', 'Tom Hardy', 'Damien Bonnard']",Christopher Nolan,2017.0,war,"For a teenager today, Dunkirk must seem even more distant than the Boer War did to my generation growing up just after WW2. For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.""Dunkirk"" focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute. Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on ""Survivor"". He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then ""helps"" wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; ""There's no hiding from this thing son,"" he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of ""The Dam Busters"", but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.
The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of ""Atonement"".An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene. This is a film that demands more than one viewing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/?ref_=sr_i_32
The Deer Hunter,8.1,"['Robert De Niro', 'Christopher Walken', 'John Cazale', 'John Savage', 'Meryl Streep']",Michael Cimino,1978.0,war,"""The Deer Hunter"" is not a film about the Vietnam war, as it is wrongly said in many cases.""The Deer Hunter"" is a film tells the story of 3 friends within about 5-6 years, during which their friendship is repeatedly put to the test.It is primarily a picture of the contemporary life of a group of people around 30 living in a small American town during the Vietnam war.The first hour of the film portrays the every day life of three friends Mike (De Niro), Steven (Savage) and Nick (Walken), who look forward to Steve's wedding but at the same time have to prepare for their commitment in Vietnam. The main actors (above all De Niro and Walken) perfectly picture the character's inner conflict between their easygoing home town life and the forthcoming assignment in Vietnam. Despite this conflict the characters don't show their concerns to their environment.Particularly Nick is worried about him and his friends leaving his home town and perhaps never coming back, but he only tells his best friend Mike of his thoughts, who is much more resolute and sees their engagement as a strong masculine act.Cimino manages to show the simple irrationality of young men, going to a senseless war from which they might never return for the only purpose of glory and approval, and abandoning their settled and happy life for it. The spectator just can't understand why those young men voluntarily sign for the army and give up everything they have. The passage from the small-town-idyll to the war cruelty is greatly pictured. Cimino does not show the three friends' way to Vietnam or the training, he immediately switches from a happy get-together to the cruel war captivity of the Vietcong. This passage perfectly underlines the contrast and the inexplicability of the three men's actions.Although the passage that is set in Vietnam is only about one third of the whole film long, the war is omnipresent at any time, which is probably the best benefit of the whole film, Cimino does not need to bomb the spectator with pictures of crying children, mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields in order to illustrate the cruelty of war. Far from it! The changed behavior of all characters after the friends' returns tell more about wars' capability of changing someone's life, than anything else.And the fact that the many dreams that these three friends had before they went to Vietnam didn't come true, because of their longing for recognition by becoming an acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings.Cimino's great directing and the cast's awesome acting provide for a touching and honest drama about the friendship of a group of young men, that is destroyed by the Vietnam war.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077416/?ref_=sr_i_33

Hacksaw Ridge,8.1,"['Andrew Garfield', 'Sam Worthington', 'Luke Bracey', 'Teresa Palmer', 'Richard Pyros']",Mel Gibson,2016.0,war,"I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn't sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan's country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the 'using kind of religion'. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/?ref_=sr_i_36

Platoon,8.1,"['Charlie Sheen', 'Tom Berenger', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Keith David', 'Forest Whitaker']",Oliver Stone,1986.0,war,"Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone's Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. In Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man's highest value... life.Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the ""enemy"" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. Elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.Platoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn't any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.The best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80's, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don't watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/?ref_=sr_i_38

The Pianist,8.5,"['Adrien Brody', 'Thomas Kretschmann', 'Frank Finlay', 'Emilia Fox', 'Michal Zebrowski']",Roman Polanski,2002.0,war,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Herv√© de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/?ref_=sr_i_40
Full Metal Jacket,8.3,"['Matthew Modine', 'R. Lee Ermey', ""Vincent D'Onofrio"", 'Adam Baldwin', 'Dorian Harewood']",Stanley Kubrick,1987.0,war,"""With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black"". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/?ref_=sr_i_41
The Patriot,7.2,"['Mel Gibson', 'Heath Ledger', 'Joely Richardson', 'Jason Isaacs', 'Chris Cooper']",Roland Emmerich,2000.0,war,"""The Patriot"", the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence, is sometimes used, together with ""Braveheart"", as evidence of a supposed anti-British prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson, who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy (hardly the stance of a Brit-hating bigot). Although ""Braveheart"", which he produced and directed, was very much Gibson's own pet project, he was neither the producer, director or scriptwriter of ""The Patriot"". Indeed, he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down, reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.Because of its anti-British stance, the film was badly received in Britain. One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. One commentator went so far as to say that it was the sort of film that the Nazis might have made about the American Revolution had they won World War II. Unlike some of my fellow-countrymen, I was not too worried about this aspect of the film. The total death toll in the American War of Independence was remarkably low, not only by modern standards but even by the standards of other wars of this era, such as the Napoleonic War. Nevertheless, in every war ever fought there have been crimes on both sides, and the War of Independence was no exception. (The rebels could be as ruthless as the British, but none of their atrocities are shown in this film). Some of the deeds attributed to Tavington may be fictitious, such as the church-burning scene, but in real life Tarleton had a well-deserved reputation for brutality, and was not only loathed by the American colonists but also distrusted by his own side. In the film the British commander Lord Cornwallis is shown as outwardly gentlemanly and honourable, but prepared secretly to countenance Tavington's methods. In reality, Cornwallis wanted to have Tarleton court-martialled; Tarleton was only saved by his influential connections.I did, however, have some reservations about the way these events were portrayed. It was originally intended to make the film about Francis Marion, a real-life figure. Unfortunately Marion, although undoubtedly courageous and a skilled guerrilla leader, was also a slave-owner (as any landowner of substance in 1770s South Carolina would have been) and was therefore deemed unworthy to be the hero of a modern blockbuster (even though a TV series about him was made in the fifties). His exploits, therefore, are credited to a fictitious ""Benjamin Martin"". The slavery issue could have been avoided by moving the action to, say, New England, but instead the film gives us a wholly unrealistic picture of race relations in the period. The black workers on Martin's land are all free men, and black and white live together in harmony, with black soldiers willingly fighting alongside whites in the Continental Army. This sort of dishonest, idealised portrayal of slavery was at one time common in films like ""Gone with the Wind"", but I thought that it had died out with the growth of the Civil Rights movement.(Incidentally, a reason why so many Southerners supported the revolutionaries was that slavery had been declared illegal in Britain itself in 1771 and they feared that the British Parliament would eventually legislate to ban it in the colonies. Needless to say, there is no mention of this attitude in the film. In later life Tarleton became MP for Liverpool, and a vehement defender of slavery. In this, if in nothing else, he and Marion had something in common).My other reservation about the film's political stance is similar to Ford's. The film probably concentrated so heavily on British brutality because it is difficult to interest a modern audience, even an American audience, in the actual reasons why the war was fought. It is easy to make out an intellectual case for the principle of ""no taxation without representation"", which had been part of British constitutional thought since at least the Civil War in the 1640s. It is much less easy to justify the spilling of blood in defence of that principle, and Martin, scarred by his experiences in the French and Indian Wars, is originally shown as a pacifist, unwilling to fight or to support the Declaration of Independence which he believes will lead to war. His son Gabriel, however, joins the Continental Army, but is wrongly accused of being a spy and threatened with execution. Tavington, believing Martin to be a rebel sympathiser, burns down his home and murders another son, Thomas. Martin is forced to take up arms to defend his family and then forms a guerrilla band which he leads against the British. Despite the title of the film, however, Martin is not really motivated by patriotism; he seems less a patriot than a pacifist who has abandoned his principles in order to seek revenge.The film is attractively photographed, although I felt that it sometimes showed a sanitised, prettified version of eighteenth-century life. In some ways it reminded me of ""The Last Samurai"", another visually attractive epic flawed by a dishonest approach to history and by excessive length, although I would rate it slightly higher, largely because Gibson makes a more commanding and impressive epic hero than does Tom Cruise. From the viewpoint of anyone without patriotic preconceptions, it can be seen simply as an exciting (if overlong) adventure film- my wife, who is not British by birth, was cheering on Martin and booing Tavington. Nevertheless, its approach to history never gets beyond a simplified story of heroes and villains. 6/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/?ref_=sr_i_42

The main lead is a young boy named Renato, and through his perfectly understandable obsession of a married woman named Malena (there couldn't be a more perfect cast than Monica Bellucci in this role),we get to see him maturing over a few years time. Most of the team focuses on Malena of course, but it's all through Renato's eyes (he's stalking her all the time), and his affection for her. It's no wonder that all males in the town (even teenagers) mostly view her as a hot piece of meat, but this boy's pure love is what eventually makes the difference in his (and her) life.The ending credits will leave you with the ""life goes on"" aftermath and possibly the strongest feeling of melancholy you ever achieved from a movie.Great cinematography, excellent performances from Monica Bellucci(though she barely speaks throughout the film) and the boy playing Renato, amazing score by the grand Maestro Ennio Morricone (nominated for an Oscar), this film has become my absolute favourite and Monica Bellucci my most recent (and strongest) obsession! A perfect 10, though it might seem over the top to a few of you.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213847/?ref_=sr_i_46
Im Westen nichts Neues,7.8,"['Felix Kammerer', 'Albrecht Schuch', 'Aaron Hilmer', 'Moritz Klaus', 'Adrian Gr√ºnewald']",Edward Berger,2022.0,war,"This is not strictly-speaking an adaption of Erich Maria Remarque's classic. A few minor incidents from the novel are included, but Remarque's biggest contribution to this film is the title. Given the ending of the film (as opposed to the book) the title is somewhat misleading, but it's such a classic that the film-makers' decision is quite understandable.This is a brutal and uncompromising study of the realities of war. The fact the the war depicted took place more than a hundred years ago doesn't make it any less relevant. It could be shown in Ukraine today, and soldiers on both sides would understand.Nor is the film's anti-war message terribly new. It is, however, a message that needs to be repeated over and over again, until (maybe) enough people take it seriously.The battle scenes are appallingly visceral - possibly the best of their type since the opening of Saving Private Ryan.The history of any war is written by the winners, but that doesn't stop them being a tragedy for the poor grunts on the losing side as well.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016150/?ref_=sr_i_47

Featuring an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the story it is based upon.

La vita √® bella,8.6,"['Roberto Benigni', 'Nicoletta Braschi', 'Giorgio Cantarini', 'Giustino Durano', 'Sergio Bini Bustric']",Roberto Benigni,1997.0,war,"Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/?ref_=sr_i_49

As a huge fan of those two shows I was really looking forward to this and it did not disappoint! It continues to follow the Dutton family and show how they created the Yellowstone ranch. This obviously takes place in 1923 during prohibition and the Great Depression. It's another gritty western from Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan is one of the best things going on television right now, everything he touches turns to gold. Just look at his resume (Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, Sicario, Hell or High Water, etc.). Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren lead an amazing cast who are all at their best here.

The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/?ref_=sr_i_3

This is the prequel to Yellowstone as it shows the Dutton family as they travel from Texas to Montana looking for a better life. It's created by Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone, Mayor of Kingstown, etc.). Sheridan has turned in one great show after another and this one is no different. It's a very gritty and violent show that showed off the realness of the Wild West. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special.

The only reason it came to my attention after multiple years of being a completed series is because it kept showing up in my Hulu queue as something I might be interested in, so, eventually, I tuned in and kept tuning in because of the excellent casting and acting, dialogue, and overall production; in other words, it really is a great series. Why did I love to hate it?; because the ""bad guys"" won a lot more than the ""good guys"". ""Justified"" is essentially a ""Wild, Wild West"" drama relocated to the hills of Kentucky where gold and black gold have been replaced by the illicit drug trade and greed and abject poverty keep the wheels constantly greased; bodies drop like matchsticks and life is basically worthless to those around you who's only moral code is ""don't get caught"", and most don't because many of the ""powers that be"" are either in on it, or, just don't care. Sounds depressing, I know, and, sometimes, I could only watch an episode at a time, however, I continued to watch it until the end (there were also times I could swear the banjo from ""Deliverance"" was going to play which gives credence to the quality of production). I'd recommend at least tuning in once - you might like it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489428/?ref_=sr_i_6
Walker,6.2,"['Jared Padalecki', 'Molly Hagan', 'Keegan Allen', 'Violet Brinson', 'Kale Culley']",Creator,2021.0,western,I actually enjoyed Walker more than I thought I would.

He returns to try to put his life and family back together. He returns to his job as Texas Ranger only to find out that the job has changed too. It seems like most of the people who don't like it are comparing it to the original and don't like that it's different. Just try to enjoy it for what it is and that's a pretty darn good show. I'm a fan Padalecki from his time on Supernatural and he's good in this too.

If you didn't read the book and just went to see the movie, you would get a movie for the time and the money. If you read the book, like I did, you will feel cheated of some of the most crucial moments from the book. I don't feel that there were any needless parts in the movie. I can't even tell you how you could've added more. But I do feel like this would've thrived better if it would've been a mini series. There is literally no time to develop character relationships. It also lacked a lot of the faith and the connectivity to the Bible that it's famous for.The actors were wonderful though. The actor who played Michael is smaller than described in the book but you quickly connect with him. The actress who played Angel was terrific also! Duke is dashing but as monstrous as the book portrays him to be.Overall I'm not sorry I saw it but I will certainly go back to the book and likely won't need to see the movie beyond maybe one more showing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11365186/?ref_=sr_i_9

It is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing, the whole cast (Tom Hardy is great here) is great. The costumes and weapons used (early 1800s) look so damn good. The story is very simple and not complicated. It is about revenge and surviving in the cold and icy wilderness of 1823. The action scenes are brutal and gritty, like they should be for that time period. Officially in my top 10 movies of all time. If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it or buy it. It definitely deserves to be in your collection. Some people might not like all the spiritual stuff or reading subtitles (lots of Native American language here) but it is needed since there a lot of interaction with Native American tribes here.

Gunsmoke,8.1,"['James Arness', 'Milburn Stone', 'Amanda Blake', 'Ken Curtis', 'Dennis Weaver']",Creators,1955.0,western,"""Gunsmoke"" was the first television Western. The longevity of the series is for two basic reasons: excellent scripts and and excellent casting. James Arness as Matt Dillon and Milburn Stone as Doc Adams remained with the series for all 20 years; Amanda Blake as Kitty was a regular for 19 years; Dennis Weaver as Chester (""Have a cup of coffee, Mr. Dillon"") for 9 years; and Ken Curtis as Festus for the last 11 years. The writers never felt compelled to changing the characters to hype the story, like marrying off Matt and Kitty. The stories were adult, and frequently had endings that the Lone Ranger would not have appreciated. Even Buck Taylor as Newly and Glenn Strange as Sam the bartender were cast members for many years, Taylor until the the series ended and Strange until his death. . When ""Gunsmoke"" was abruptly canceled, it still had solid ratings, so the cancellation was a surprise. At the time, CBS was known for its capricious programming changes during a period when they were trying to appeal to a younger audience.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/?ref_=sr_i_11
Tombstone,7.8,"['Kurt Russell', 'Val Kilmer', 'Sam Elliott', 'Bill Paxton', 'Powers Boothe']",George P. Cosmatos,1993.0,western,"The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an uncharismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.It opens with Earp ending his stint as a Kansas law officer and heading for Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan and their families in toe. Upon arrival they meet up with their good friend and Ally Doc Holliday and before long they've acquired a share in a thriving little saloon and card game. A group of ruthless bandits ironically titled 'The Cowboys', also inhabit the town and they take an immediate disliking to the retired lawman's reputation and moral attitudes. So far, Wyatt had done well to keep himself clear of any kind of feuding or trouble, but one fateful night a barbarous act forces him to arrest Curly Bill Brocious the leader of the desperadoes. This eventually results with the historic showdown at the OK Corral and a quest to rid the land from the curse of these malevolent outlaws.On his audio commentary for the Tom Cruise drama Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe describes Kurt Russell as 'Hollywood's best kept secret'. Showing flashes of Clint Eastwood, but without ever looking like he's trying to imitate him, he provides a competent lead and proves that there's certainly a lot of truth to that statement. From his humorous will they won't they yearnings for Jose, to his anguished rage as he screams, `.Hell's coming with me' into the stormy night sky, Russell's on top form. His excellence can't help but play second fiddle to a scene stealing Val Kilmer, who has some of the best dialogue since Mr Blonde shared breakfast with a group of crimms in black suits. Hitting a career high, it's seems surprising that the Academy didn't acknowledge such a worthy portrayal.  The camaraderie between he and Earp is one of Cinema's most pleasurable buddy pairings and no one can deny the pathos he creates in his tragic exit. His rivalry with an underused but adequate Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo is compelling and their dual makes for an irresistible climax. Dana Delaney also shines as the Marshall's 'other' love interest, but frankly with a cast studded with cameos from so many familiar faces - even Charlton Heston - you could give a gibbon the megaphone and the results would probably still feel fairly acceptable!The set locations are the standard cowboy fare, but director Cosmatos manages to make good use of them. The stormy night scenes when Morgan is attacked are crafted to create an electric atmosphere that is superbly lighted and the same can be said for the suspense made in the neatly staged shoot-outs. Clearly accomplished as an action director, Cosmatos certainly was the right Man for this rootin' tootin' ride through the Wild West. He shows a flare for building tension that runs smoothly throughout the beautifully shot set pieces.The only complaint that can be made about Tombstone is the lack of any real depth found within the story. Where as genre classics like Unforgiven offer an emotionally charged drama that snuggles so neatly with the always-ungratuitous gunplay, Kevin Jarre's story falls into the 'popcorn western' category. Along with its contemporaries Young guns or The Quick and the Dead, the movie aims more for blockbuster appeal than a deep and endearing dramatic approach. Still, fans of a six-shooter will find plenty to be impressed by - in this admirable character-led mix of gunplay, companionship, romance and even just the right amount of pathos. Fans still ask which is the better of the two accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that were strangely released around the same time. Well I guess the answer really depends on your personnel taste in movies. If you like the more dramatic western and have no problem with an epic runtime, then Costner and co's biopic maybe the one for you. However if you're looking for a 'popcorn' take on the lawman's life then you need look no further. Tombstone's your movie! It may not have a deep heart, but it's a hell of a lot of fun! 8/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358/?ref_=sr_i_12

This particular story is not real, but everything you see in the movie did happen, and more, muuuuch more. I am Chilean, or British and Native descent, and I have read on the topic extensively. What European settlers did in Patagonia will blow anyone's mind and this movie is a bit of refreshing justice on a world who chooses to forget. A must watch if you have the guts to face your ancestors history. Not a film for cowards.I recommend anyone who wants to really know what Europeans did to google a little about it, and you'll find plenty about the Selknam, Alacalufe, Onas, Yaganes and many others who perished to feed and clothe the Europeans of the 19th and 20th century.

Deadwood,8.6,"['Timothy Olyphant', 'Ian McShane', 'Molly Parker', 'Brad Dourif', 'W. Earl Brown']",Creator,2004.0,western,"This stands out for me as one of the best series I have ever seen hit the small screen. The attention to detail,story and character is second to none. Deadwood is brought to life by the good, the bad and the very ugly- with some of the most wonderfully theatrically profane, but ultra-realistic dialogue of any western. True, you could question some of the dialogue for exactly how accurate it is to the time it is set- but it sounds absolutely convincing in the world they have managed to build. Lets face it- not too many Westerns even bothered all that much in the first place! The 3 series have impeccable standards of production, weaving some of the real historical events of the time into a fictional Old West testament. The degradation, ill manners, costumes, dirt, mud and profanities are all present and accounted for.Aside from the ""real"" characters we know of from Deadwood (Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane and even the Sheriff Bullock), we have some of the most unsavoury villains of the time as well.The various stories, historical events and personal issues of the characters interweave with no discernible template or pattern to formalise the show. The only thing that is certain in the old West is that where the desire for excess, fortune and greed are combined, human nature will see to the rest.Stand out performances are plentiful in this series- but Ian McShane is incredible, a true tour-de-force, a foul-mouthed, back-stabbing bad ass villain- who manages to humanise a repellent character in Al Swearengen.As the series wore on, the writers broadened his character and nature a little more so it was unavoidable but to side with him- even agree with his nastiest ideas.This was not a compromise or sell-out of the principally dark natured and notoriously ill-tempered brothel owner! ""Sparks"" of humanity seem to have warmed his character, particularly from his confrontations with the flint-like moral code & core of Sheriff Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). However, even Bullocks is prone to questionable actions, as he wrestles with his own conscience to resolve things in a ""civil"" way, or resort to a pistol-whipping to get the job done.If you have never seen this- look out for repeats or go buy the box sets and enjoy the best Western experience ever made. My only regret is that its all over after 3 series (apart from a couple of 2 hour specials they plan to make to round it off.) Short but ever so sweet!!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348914/?ref_=sr_i_15
"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo",8.8,"['Clint Eastwood', 'Eli Wallach', 'Lee Van Cleef', 'Aldo Giuffr√®', 'Luigi Pistilli']",Sergio Leone,1966.0,western,"I wasn't aware of the wild taste of Western. This movie made me love Western. I don't know any movie can achieve being this much effective nearly without any drama. Nearly every great movie is carried by some drama between characters.Yes it has a little bit drama. It shows the greediness of humanity just like The Treasue of Sierra Madre. It refletcs conflicts between three different types of men. Also I love how Eastwood's character is nameless in The Man Without Name Trilogy. Sometimes the trilogy also called The Dollar Trilogy.Besides the storyline the techincs are breathtaking.Acting performances are just breathtaking. If you didn't notice that much of acting skills, then you should check Trivias of the movie.The Scores just one of the bests. Morricone just made the most iconic scores. From that time until now, every Western score has his iconic type.Set decoration is about something enormous in this movie. They really did something great with that too.Costume design and makeups are also so good.

The Hateful Eight,7.8,"['Samuel L. Jackson', 'Kurt Russell', 'Jennifer Jason Leigh', 'Walton Goggins', 'Demi√°n Bichir']",Quentin Tarantino,2015.0,western,"This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.The blizzard provides the necessary isolation to the story. These characters are stuck with each other, and this forced closeness is central to the story - they're all Hateful, and that hate reverberates among them, destroying peace and hope. Hate is what brings them together and hate is what tears them apart. The blizzard also provides some interesting incidental elements that are fascinating to watch, like the hardship of a simple task like preparing guidelines, or going to the outhouse, and the cold hell explodes inward at times (when the door is opened) with punctuating effect, providing some breaks to the narrative, and even some needed laughs.And the bar... This film's action takes place primarily in one large room. It feels very much like a stage play (as another reviewer mentioned), allowing greater intimacy with the characters and their interactions, while providing us with an opportunity to witness multiple scenarios unfolding at the same time. This density of action is very cool. We are afforded third person omniscience without losing connection with the motives and perspectives of the players.And the stage setting meshes very integrally with the acting. We see the principal actors doing top-notch with not only their primary motivational actions, but nearly every choice in blocking and busy action. The director and production team make a very wise choice in showing the small little details of what's going on here. Attention is paid to realistic procedural actions, and reactions, for these details. The result is that we see characters behaving in reasonable ways to their environments, pausing to disarm a stranger, or undo a shackle, not simply because the plot calls for it, but because it's a reasonable choice that they would make at the time. Very refreshing to see, actually.On the negative side, Tarrantino's choice to use narration was weakly executed. I don't know if there would have been a way to do this without narration, but the actual usage detracted from the ongoing story. Also, there were a few points in the action where the characters seemed to be a little too accepting of the events that transpire around them. This is purely a fault of direction/writing.But overall, a very watchable film, that is notably unafraid to portray some very dirty and uncomfortable bits of the human psyche. Some folks seem to have an issue with this last part. My advice to them is to loosen up a bit and accept art that hurts a little.

Longmire,8.3,"['Robert Taylor', 'Katee Sackhoff', 'Lou Diamond Phillips', 'Cassidy Freeman', 'Adam Bartley']",Creators,2012.0,western,"I really enjoyed the show. It reminded me of a Louis L'Amour novel. I haven't read the books this show is based on, but I plan to soon. I appreciated the pace, and overall feel of it. I felt completely absorbed in the realness of the characters, and really felt like I was in Wyoming. No glitzy computerized special effects, and no unrealistically fast crime scene analysis. I am looking forward to ""getting to know"" the characters. I loved the little town square, the Wranglers, and the scenery is breathtaking. I also enjoyed the music. Very happy the show includes one of my favorite actresses, Katee Sackhoff.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1836037/?ref_=sr_i_19

Unforgiven,8.2,"['Clint Eastwood', 'Gene Hackman', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Richard Harris', 'Jaimz Woolvett']",Clint Eastwood,1992.0,western,"In 1992, Clint Eastwood created the last and greatest western; 'Unforgiven'. A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied ""I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I'm here to kill you¬Ö"". He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw. The score, though not used often is very refreshing and moving.'Unforgiven' is an unforgettable look on life, man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the '90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.9/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/?ref_=sr_i_22
C'era una volta il West,8.5,"['Henry Fonda', 'Charles Bronson', 'Claudia Cardinale', 'Jason Robards', 'Gabriele Ferzetti']",Sergio Leone,1968.0,western,This is my fav film. It is more like watching a piece of art. The look is fantastic. The director does a perfect job. The acting is wonderful. The story is not the strongest ever but it should be watched to experience it. If your a film lover you can't fail but admire this film.Charles Bronson is the perfect broody loner. Henry Fonda surprises everyone by giving a strong performance as a bad guy. The close up of his eyes is stunning. The camera work and close ups have never been done better. The music is as good as anything you will find in a movie. Throw in the scenes when you first see Henry Fonda. The scene at the railway station which the water dripping on the hat. The sound of the spinning water tower. To me the closet movie to ART i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films.,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116/?ref_=sr_i_23
Silverado,7.2,"['Kevin Kline', 'Scott Glenn', 'Kevin Costner', 'Rosanna Arquette', 'John Cleese']",Lawrence Kasdan,1985.0,western,"Co-writer, producer and director Lawrence Kasdan did his part in keeping the Western genre alive with ""Silverado"". It may not be innovative, but that may well have been the point, as Kasdan aims to pay tribute to a beloved movie genre that dated all the way back to the silent era. Admittedly, this one came along when the Western was going through a bit of a dry spell, which made it all the more welcome.Four very engaging stars - Kevin Kline as Paden, Scott Glenn as Emmett, Danny Glover as Mal, Kevin Costner as Jake - are an interesting combo, as these characters, united by circumstance, eventually band together to fight against the injustices occurring in the town of Silverado. More than once, they prove their worth, in a story (written by Kasdan and his brother Mark) that is fairly episodic.""Silverado"" is extremely well shot, by John Bailey, in widescreen. It gets the look of a classic Western just right. It hooks you right away with an opening moment of quiet suddenly interrupted by a gunfight, and promises a substantial amount of entertainment to come when we're introduced to the tough and resilient Emmett and get a load of the majestic New Mexico locations. Admittedly, this doesn't work quite as well when you start to think about it too much, so it's better to just go with the flow and appreciate all that Kasdan and his cast & crew have packed into this presentation. Certainly, it would be hard not to get roused by that stirring and wonderful music score composed by Bruce Broughton.There's a lot of acting talent to go around here, but giving things a curious quality is some unexpected casting. Linda Hunt? Jeff Goldblum? JOHN CLEESE? Rosanna Arquette is fairly appealing if somewhat aloof as the gal who catches both Klines' and Glenns' eyes. Jeff Fahey makes his film debut as scruffy psycho Tyree. Lovely ladies Amanda Wyss and Lynn Whitfield play local girl Phoebe and Mals' sister respectively. Recognizable character players in the cast include Marvin J. McIntyre, Sheb Wooley, James Gammon, Ray Baker, Joe Seneca, Earl Hindman, Jim Haynie, Richard Jenkins (also making his film debut), Pepe Serna, Ted White, and an uncredited Brion James as Hobart, the wagon master. The real standout for this viewer is Brian Dennehy, who never overplays his role as villainous sheriff Cobb, instead suffusing the character with a good deal of charm.The pacing rarely slows down, and the action scenes are first rate. Especially good is a scene involving a stampede.While lacking the overall impact for this viewer to consider it great, it's still pretty fun while it lasts.Seven out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090022/?ref_=sr_i_24
City Slickers,6.8,"['Billy Crystal', 'Jack Palance', 'Daniel Stern', 'Bruno Kirby', 'Patricia Wettig']",Ron Underwood,1991.0,western,"Few other comedic filmmakers understand the west on a comedic, farcical level than Ron Underwood. Just a year before directing City Slickers, Underwood directed one of my favorite contemporary comedy/horror films, Tremors, about a small, rather unpopulated town in Nevada being literally swallowed by mutant, underground worms. The film was not just fun to watch, but fun to imagine that deep underground there are large, unearthly worms that have remained undetected by elaborate seismographs and are now resurfacing to swallow anything that could cause a detectable vibration underground. Needless to say, after watching it when I was eight, I took extra-quiet steps.And here's City Slickers, a comedy that uses the wild west as a background for numerous visual gags, snappy wordplay, and a trio of great performances. The three guys are Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal), a radio advertiser who is experiencing his midlife crisis after turning thirty-nine, Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern), who is stuck in a sexless marriage in the midst of managing a grocery store, and Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby), a womanizer uncomfortable with the notion that there is a time to ""settle down."" On his birthday, Mitch is given a present from his two buds which is a vacation down on a southern cattle drive. Reluctantly, he accepts, and before they know it, they are defending the cattle drive in true western fashion.Billy Crystal is an ideal character for Mitch. He has the right balance of comedic wit and dramatic potency to make a character like this work well on the basis of being a sadsack but also a compelling lead. Stern and Kirby work well in the supporting characters, mainly because they themselves have good comedic timing and work well off of Crystal's lead.City Slickers works better than another western farce by the name of Three Amigos, which was stunningly mediocre in its inclusion of three hilarious comedians - Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short - and successfully finding nothing interesting to do with them. The film drifted from one stale setup to another, falling flat on its face, before stumbling over to the next contrived setup and doing the same. Too many instances in the film were dry and the laugh to actor ration was surprisingly very low.City Slickers works because writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel know how to effectively utilize their talent and give each character sustainable depth and energy to run for the near-two hour runtime the film holds. In that time, the film is often funny, kind of poignant, a little overlong, but heartfelt all the more. It's some kind of minor miracle this was well-received by a general public.Starring: Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby. Directed by: Ron Underwood.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/?ref_=sr_i_25
The Dead Don't Hurt,7.0,"['Vicky Krieps', 'Viggo Mortensen', 'Solly McLeod', 'Garret Dillahunt', 'W. Earl Brown']",Viggo Mortensen,2023.0,western,"I had really enjoyed ""Falling"" as well, Viggo Mortensen's directorial debut, but this film is a step up. It admittedly does not target as heavy a subject as his previous film, but it is written, directed, and acted (by the whole cast, especially the leading actors) beautifully. The cinematography and music are really thoughtfully put together as well, and do a good job capturing the 19th century look, without coming across as contrived. Glad to see Viggo going from strength to strength. I hope the film is recognized for the great work it is. Fun to get a glimpse of Anduril as well :) Highly recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22773644/?ref_=sr_i_26
Legends of the Fall,7.5,"['Brad Pitt', 'Anthony Hopkins', 'Aidan Quinn', 'Julia Ormond', 'Henry Thomas']",Edward Zwick,1994.0,western,"I absolutely loved the movie, it's the second time I'm seeing it and I'm glad I did, because I love epic dramas...and this one well, not only did it have a great and an original storyline, it had a great cast also. But my favorite had to be Brad Pitt, his performance was engaging and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, because I simply was fascinated by the way the story was constructed. I've read a few comments made here...and this film is everything but predictable. It has so many twists and turns that it just keeps you wondering until the end...where you feel like you've watched the film to its fullest and there's no more stories left untold, that's what I look for in a good film. Even though the story was tragic, it was a story of love, loyalty and family. I give it a 9/10...if you haven't seen this movie yet...SEE IT! You'll love it, even if you don't fancy Brad Pitt.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110322/?ref_=sr_i_27
